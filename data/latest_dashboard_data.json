Any attempt to move the listing would be highly controversial and a significant blow to the London stock market and the U.K. life sciences sector, which the Labor government set as a priority in its industrial strategy.Continue to STAT+ to read the full story…",

      "description": "Top of the morning to you. And a steamy one, it is. In fact, there is more steam rising from the grounds of the Pharmalot campus than from our ritual cup of stimulation; our choice today is marshmallow magic, by the way. But this is to be expected at this time of year, yes? In any event, there is work to be done, so as always, we have assembled a few items of interest for you. After all, the world keeps spinning no matter what the thermometer says. Hope you have a successful day and conquer the world. And of course, do keep in touch. …\nNovo Nordisk’s top executives ignored internal warnings that the company was not sufficiently prepared for the launch of its weight loss drug Wegovy, leaving the drugmaker in a more vulnerable position when rival Eli Lilly entered the market, Reuters reports. Novo has enjoyed $46 billion in net profits since 2021, when Wegovy became the first highly effective obesity treatment approved in the U.S. But Lilly’s Zepbound therapy outstripped Wegovy in weekly new prescriptions this year as Novo struggles to convince investors it can remain competitive amid the weight loss drug boom. Novo is reorganizing its leadership team following the surprise ouster of chief executive office Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen. Other key executives already stepped down, including U.S. chief Doug Langa, who had insisted on a commercial launch soon after Wegovy’s U.S. approval. In heated internal discussions, sales and marketing executives urged Langa to first secure more supply and health insurance coverage, without which many patients could not afford Wegovy’s monthly cost of up to $1,300. Lilly was not expected to enter the market for at least two years and Novo could have been better prepared, according to former employees.\nThe House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed a former Pfizer executive who is considered central to its investigation into an allegation that clinical testing related to the development of the company’s Covid-19 vaccine was purposefully delayed until after the 2020 presidential election, CNN reports. The demand for documents and a deposition from Philip Dormitzer comes after the committee says he failed to comply with requests to appear voluntarily and turn over records. Dormitzer is a key figure in the legislative probe. The committee has alleged it had information that the former Pfizer executive, after he left for a job with GSK, told his colleagues that Pfizer had delayed announcing its Covid vaccine was effective until after the election. The Wall Street Journal had reported that GSK brought those claims to federal prosecutors in Manhattan. But Dormitzer disputed that there had been any delay in seeking approval for the vaccine.Continue to STAT+ to read the full story…",

      "description": "Multiple blockbuster drugs set to lose exclusivity, producing one of the pharmaceutical industry’s most financially significant patent cliffs in over a decade, according to GlobalData.\nOncology is one of the key therapy areas set to be affected by pricing pressures as drug patents expire.\nPharma companies will need to “rethink revenue strategies, pipeline investments, and lifecycle management to safeguard long-term growth”, as a greater number of biosimilars and generic medicines gain market entry, according to a recent report by the data and analytics company.\nAs such, the US market is expected to lose over $230 billion over the next five years. Only a few big pharma companies are positioned to grow revenue sustainably through 2030, stated GlobalData.\nWhich blockbuster drugs could be impacted in the next pharmaceutical patent cliff?\nMajor drugs including Merck’s Keytruda and Johnson & Johnson’s Darzalex/Faspro will lose US exclusivity by 2029. While these medicines are expected to remain in the top 10 selling drugs by the end of the decade, their revenue is expected to decline, GlobalData added.\nHowever, Bristol Myers Squibb is one of the companies forecast to be impacted the most by the upcoming patent cliff, with its blockbuster drugs Eliquis and Opdivo losing exclusivity.\n\n“To effectively navigate a patent cliff, companies must deploy a range of strategies… life cycle management and patent thickets can be effective tools to extend market exclusivity and defend against generic competition”\n\n“More than half of the top 15 pharma companies are expected to face challenges in managing the impact of the upcoming patent cliff. However, some companies have pipeline drugs forecast to offset part of these losses,” explained George El-Helou, Strategic Intelligence Analyst at GlobalData.\n“To effectively navigate a patent cliff, companies must deploy a range of strategies to offset losses and strengthen their long-term position. These may include acquiring early-stage biotechs developing promising therapies and increasing investment in R&D, targeting diseases with high unmet needs. Additionally, life cycle management and patent thickets can be effective tools to extend market exclusivity and defend against generic competition,” El-Helou added.\nYet, impact of the pharmaceutical patent cliff on provides a “significant opportunity” for pharma companies, according to Hannah Hans, Head of Pharma Strategic Intelligence at GlobalData. This includes biotechs partnering with pharma “on next generation therapies, novel delivery platforms and differentiated formulations”.\nThe post Next drug patent cliff to challenge Big Pharma strategy appeared first on European Pharmaceutical Review.",

      "description": "Top of the morning to you. And a fine one it is, despite the clouds enveloping the Pharmalot campus. Birds are chirping, neighbors are mulling about, and the official mascots are scurrying across the grounds in search of creatures to annoy. As for us, we are as busy as ever hunting and gathering items of interest. We trust you have your own hectic agendas. So join us as we hoist the ever-present cup of stimulation — our choice today is maple bourbon — and attack the fast-growing to-do list. Have a grand day, everyone, and do stay in touch. …\nA court battle between two of the nation’s largest biotechs — Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Amgen — is testing the legal limits of how far drugmakers can go in using patents to thwart competition, STAT writes. The case is being closely watched by companies that sell biosimilar medicines amid concerns that the U.S. patent system is being gamed in ways that critics say can maintain high prices for medicines. The saga began early last year when Regeneron filed a lawsuit accusing Amgen of infringing a key patent on its best-selling Eylea injectable drug, which is used to combat such eye diseases as wet age-related macular degeneration, among other ailments. The treatment, with a list price of nearly $1,900 a shot, is at the heart of a multibillion-dollar product line. At the time, Amgen was one of several companies that hoped to sell a biosimilar version, but Amgen’s approach set it apart from the others — and paved its way to the marketplace earlier than Regeneron had hoped.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration will start publishing the rejection letters that companies until now have mostly kept hidden from investors and the public, Bloomberg News reports. “We had a long set of meetings with our lawyers to determine that we can do this,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Wall Street Week. The agency has historically left it up to drugmakers to disclose when and why their medicines are not approved. But companies often give incomplete or misleading accounts of their interactions with regulators, and that can make an application’s deficiencies seem more minor than they really are, Makary said in the interview airing Friday. “There’s an opportunity for companies to spin the results,” he said. “Now, the decision letters will be public for shareholders and the public to see.” Investors have long asked the FDA to share its reasons for rejecting drugs, arguing that companies can use the agency’s silence on the matter to mislead the market.Continue to STAT+ to read the full story…",

      "description": "Hello, everyone, and how are you today? We are doing just fine, thank you, especially since the middle of the week is already upon us. After all, we have made it this far so we have decided to hang on for another couple of days. And why not? Given the likely alternatives, this seems to be a reasonable decision. To make the time fly, we are firing up the trusted coffee kettle and brewing another cup of stimulation. Our choice today is the refreshing vanilla lavender, which occupies a prominent spot in our pantry. But now, the time has come to get cracking. Here are a few items of interest to help you get started. We hope you have a lovely day, and do keep in touch. Feedback, tips, suggestions, and, yes, criticism, are always welcome.…\nPresident Trump threatened to impose up to 200% tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. “very soon,” CNBC says. “They’re going to be tariffs at very high rate, like 200%,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting. But he suggested that those levies would not go into effect immediately, saying he will “give people about a year, year and a half. We’ll give them a certain period of time to get their act together,” Trump said, apparently referring to drugmakers bringing back manufacturing into the U.S. Details on pharmaceutical tariffs “will come at the end of the month,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said after the Cabinet meeting. The planned tariffs would deal a long-awaited blow to pharmaceutical companies, many of which have pushed back and warned that the levies could drive up costs, deter investments in the U.S., and disrupt the drug supply chain, ultimately putting patients at risk. This was Trump’s most significant comment on pharmaceutical tariffs since April, when his administration initiated a so-called Section 232 investigation on those products. That legal authority allows the commerce secretary to investigate the impact of imports on national security.\nMerck agreed to buy Verona Pharma for $10 billion to bolster its lung-disease business and help replace the expected loss of revenue when its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda loses patent protection, STAT writes. The centerpiece of the deal is Ohtuvayre, a treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that secured U.S. approval last year. The commercial launch has exceeded Wall Street expectations, with analysts forecasting $4 billion-plus in peak annual sales, according to Visible Alpha. Buying Verona will help Merck replace revenue it expects to lose when Keytruda, the cancer immunotherapy drug that generates $30 billion per year in sales, loses patent protection starting in 2028. This is the largest Merck acquisition since the company bought Prometheus Biosciences for $11 billion in 2023 and Acceleron Pharma for $11.5 billion in 2021. Merck currently markets Winrevair, a medicine to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, that it acquired through the Acceleron deal. Continue to STAT+ to read the full story…",

As always, we hope you have a meaningful and productive day. And of course, do stay in touch. …\nA report issued by four U.S. senators into the growing partnerships between direct-to-consumer telehealth companies and pharmaceutical manufacturers found the business relationships may indirectly lead patients and providers toward certain branded medications, STAT explains. The report comes after both Pfizer and Eli Lilly in the past two years launched websites that, among other things, connect patients with a telehealth provider for conditions their medications treat. The drug companies maintain the opportunity to “talk to a doctor now” increases access to care. But the legislators, and some health policy watchers, worry that relationships between drug and telehealth companies could drive patients toward expensive and unnecessary medications. Eli Lilly’s contracts for telehealth links, the report found, pay a total of $942,500 over three years to three telehealth providers. One of Pfizer’s telehealth providers charges each of its pharmaceutical clients between $510,000 and $2.45 million over a three-year contract. But both telehealth providers and their pharmaceutical partners have said that clinician decisions about which drug to prescribe are uninfluenced by the contracts.\nBristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer plan to sell the widely used blood thinner Eliquis directly to patients at a discounted cash price — a move that follows pressure from the Trump administration on the pharmaceutical industry to cut drug prices, The Wall Street Journal reports. The companies, which have a joint venture that markets Eliquis, said the new service will allow uninsured or underinsured patients to buy the pill at more than 40% off the current list price starting Sept. 8. The service will provide direct shipping of the drug to patients in the U.S. The joint venture decided to launch the direct-sales service for Eliquis after discussions with the Trump administration about affordability. Eliquis has a list price of $606 for a 30-day supply, but will now be offered at a discounted cash price of $346 a month. Eliquis is one of the best-selling prescription drugs, generating more than $13 billion in global sales last year. It is used to prevent blood clots and to ward off strokes in people who have irregular heart rhythms. The sale of Eliquis will be available on a company website, Eliquis 360 Support, which offers copay assistance and information about the drug.Continue to STAT+ to read the full story…",

But nutrition experts say that despite MAHA’s rhetoric, these kinds of changes won’t move the needle when it comes to Americans’ health. \n“My term for this is ‘nutritionally hilarious,’” said Marion Nestle, one of the country’s foremost nutrition experts and professor emeritus at New York University. Whether Coca-Cola contains cane sugar or high-fructose corn syrup, she said, it will still contain virtually the same amount of calories and lots of sugar. (Coke currently has about 10 teaspoons a 12-ounce can.) That means soda will still pose the same risks when it comes to chronic conditions like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. “It’s the kind of thing that makes nutritionists roll their eyes, because it doesn’t make any difference,” Nestle said.  Read the rest…",

As always, we hope you have a productive day and invite you to keep in touch, especially when something saucy occurs. …\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration kicked off the reauthorization process for the eighth iteration the Prescription Drug User Fee Act on Monday, with FDA Commissioner Marty Makary saying he’d like to see lower fees paid by industry this time around, according to Regulatory Focus. For Fiscal Year 2025, the PDUFA fee for an application requiring clinical data is $4.3 million, while the annual program fee is just over $400,000. About half of FDA’s annual budget comes from its various user fee programs, most of which must be renewed before Sept. 30, 2027. The meeting was the first step of a lengthy negotiation process with industry to secure a commitment letter for the next PDUFA program. The commitment letter will provide the necessary information for Congress to pass legislation to reauthorize the program for another five years. In 1993, PDUFA user fees funded 7% of the program while in 2024, user fees funded 78% of the program. The program has grown from $135 million in 1992 to $1.7 billion in 2024.\nUse of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss rose sharply in kids and adolescents after the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2023 recommended offering medications along with lifestyle adjustments such as healthier eating and exercise, Axios writes. The findings from a review of more than 310,000 patient health records add fuel to the debate over what age is too young for Wegovy and other GLP-1 drugs. While the heavily touted drugs offer opportunities to reduce the prevalence of childhood obesity, more studies are needed about the safety of newer versions in order to make informed decisions, the researchers from health data company Truveta and Harvard Medical School wrote. They found that prescribing GLP-1 drugs for weight management in youths ages 8 to 17 increased 65% immediately and another 5% per month following the Academy of Pediatrics guideline release. The diabetes drug metformin was the most prescribed medication overall, but its use declined over time while use of semaglutide — the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy— increased substantially, from 2.5% of patients before the guidelines to 26.8%.Continue to STAT+ to read the full story…",

The proposal would allow the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to select a fixed-dose combination drug for negotiations if the agency determines it does not have a “clinically meaningful difference” compared to its original drug with the same active moiety or ingredient. Fixed-dose combinations contain multiple medications in a single dosage form to help simplify treatment for patients. The pharmaceutical industry has been resisting the proposal, raising questions about the government’s legal authority and statutory basis to implement it. If finalized, the move could be a problem for Merck’s Keytruda, Bristol Myers Squibb’s Opdivo, and Johnson & Johnson’s Darzalex — top cancer drugs that could be picked for price cuts with their fixed-dose combinations.\nDespite Trump administration efforts to shrink the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Senate appropriators unanimously advanced a funding bill last Thursday that maintains agency funding in fiscal 2026 at roughly the same level as in fiscal 2025, Politico notes. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill, which advanced by 27-0 vote, funds the agency at $7 billion, comprised of $3.6 billion in taxpayer funds and $3.4 billion in user fee revenues. That sets up a showdown with the House, which advanced a party-line FDA spending bill out of committee last month that funds the agency with $6.8 billion in total funding, in line with what President Trump asked Congress to provide to the agency. Both measures are set for floor action, but there is still no broader funding agreement in place to keep federal agencies running beyond the Sept. 30 government shutdown deadline. Congress could resort to a stopgap funding patch in the fall.Continue to STAT+ to read the full story…",

Diagnostics division sales were stable, the company said, as growing demand for pathology solutions and blood screening tests offset the effect of China’s health care pricing reforms.\nMeanwhile, Roche also announced that it was weighing direct-to-patient drug sales in the U.S., bypassing middlemen for its pricey medicines for multiple sclerosis, eye disease, and cancer, per Bloomberg. The company has discussed such a program with the U.S. government, with CEO Thomas Schinecker saying the move would bring down costs “quite quickly.” Other companies including Pfizer, Eli Lilly, and Novo Nordisk have started selling medicines via telehealth to consumers, in part to circumvent players like pharmacy benefit managers.Continue to STAT+ to read the full story…",

Each box plot represents a range of annual tuition costs, showing the distribution of NPV values within that range.\n\n### Key Trend:\n1. **General Distribution**: Across all tuition ranges, the median 40-year NPV (indicated by the line inside each box) appears to be relatively consistent, hovering around the $1,000,000 mark.\n2. **Variability**: The spread of NPV values (indicated by the height of the boxes and whiskers) is wider for higher tuition ranges, suggesting greater variability in outcomes for more expensive schools.\n3. **Outliers**: There are several outliers, particularly in the higher tuition ranges (e.g., 35-40k, 40-45k, and >50k), indicating that some individuals experience significantly higher or lower NPVs.\n\n### Notable Insight:\nOne notable insight from this chart is that higher tuition costs do not necessarily translate into a higher 40-year net present value. For example, the median NPV for the highest tuition range (>50k) is not significantly higher than that for the lowest tuition range (<5k). This suggests that the return on investment for higher tuition costs may not be proportionally greater, and other factors beyond tuition cost may play a significant role in determining long-term financial outcomes.\n\nThis insight highlights the importance of considering factors beyond just tuition costs when evaluating the potential return on investment of higher education.\n\nFunction calling example\nThis following example shows Mistral Small 3.2’s function calling by demonstrating how the model identifies when a user question needs external data and calls the correct function with proper parameters.Our prompt and input payload are as follows:\n\n# Define a simple weather function\nweather_function = {\n\"type\": \"function\",\n\"function\": {\n\"name\": \"get_weather\",\n\"description\": \"Get weather for a location\",\n\"parameters\": {\n\"type\": \"object\",\n\"properties\": {\n\"location\": {\n\"type\": \"string\",\n\"description\": \"City name\"\n}\n},\n\"required\": [\"location\"]\n}\n}\n}\n\n# User question\nuser_question = \"What's the weather like in Seattle?\"\n\n# Create payload\npayload = {\n\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_question}],\n\"tools\": [weather_function],\n\"tool_choice\": \"auto\",\n\"max_tokens\": 200,\n\"temperature\": 0.15\n}\n\n# Make prediction\nresponse = predictor.predict(payload)\n\n# Display raw response to see exactly what we get\nprint(json.dumps(response['choices'][0]['message'], indent=2))\n\n# Extract function call information from the response content\nmessage = response['choices'][0]['message']\ncontent = message.get('content', '')\n\nif '[TOOL_CALLS]' in content:\nprint(\"Function call details:\", content.replace('[TOOL_CALLS]', ''))\n\nWe get following response:\n\n{\n\"role\": \"assistant\",\n\"reasoning_content\": null,\n\"content\": \"[TOOL_CALLS]get_weather{\\\"location\\\": \\\"Seattle\\\"}\",\n\"tool_calls\": []\n}\nFunction call details: get_weather{\"location\": \"Seattle\"}\n\nClean up\nTo avoid unwanted charges, complete the following steps in this section to clean up your resources.\nDelete the Amazon Bedrock Marketplace deployment\nIf you deployed the model using Amazon Bedrock Marketplace, complete the following steps:\n\nOn the Amazon Bedrock console, under Tune in the navigation pane, select Marketplace model deployment.\nIn the Managed deployments section, locate the endpoint you want to delete.\nSelect the endpoint, and on the Actions menu, choose Delete.\nVerify the endpoint details to make sure you’re deleting the correct deployment: \n  \nEndpoint name\nModel name\nEndpoint status\n \nChoose Delete to delete the endpoint.\nIn the deletion confirmation dialog, review the warning message, enter confirm, and choose Delete to permanently remove the endpoint.\n\nDelete the SageMaker JumpStart predictor\nAfter you’re done running the notebook, make sure to delete the resources that you created in the process to avoid additional billing. For more details, see Delete Endpoints and Resources. You can use the following code:\n\npredictor.delete_model()\npredictor.delete_endpoint()\n\nConclusion\nIn this post, we showed you how to get started with Mistral-Small-3.2-24B-Instruct-2506 and deploy the model using Amazon Bedrock Marketplace and SageMaker JumpStart for inference. This latest version of the model brings improvements in instruction following, reduced repetition errors, and enhanced function calling capabilities while maintaining performance across text and vision tasks.

      "description": "Financial regulations and compliance are constantly changing, and automation of compliance reporting has emerged as a game changer in the financial industry. Amazon Web Services (AWS) generative AI solutions offer a seamless and efficient approach to automate this reporting process. The integration of AWS generative AI into the compliance framework not only enhances efficiency but also instills a greater sense of confidence and trust in the financial sector by promoting precision and timely delivery of compliance reports. These solutions help financial institutions avoid the costly and reputational consequences of noncompliance. This, in turn, contributes to the overall stability and integrity of the financial ecosystem, benefiting both the industry and the consumers it serves.\nAmazon Bedrock is a managed generative AI service that provides access to a wide array of advanced foundation models (FMs). It includes features that facilitate the efficient creation of generative AI applications with a strong focus on privacy and security. Getting a good response from an FM relies heavily on using efficient techniques for providing prompts to the FM. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a pivotal approach to augmenting FM prompts with contextually relevant information from external sources. It uses vector databases such as Amazon OpenSearch Service to enable semantic searching of the contextual information.\nAmazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, powered by vector databases such as Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, helps in implementing RAG to supplement model inputs with relevant information from factual resources, thereby reducing potential hallucinations and increasing response accuracy.\nAmazon Bedrock Agents enables generative AI applications to execute multistep tasks using action groups and enable interaction with APIs, knowledge bases, and FMs. Using agents, you can design intuitive and adaptable generative AI applications capable of understanding natural language queries and creating engaging dialogues to gather details required for using the FMs effectively.\nA suspicious transaction report (STR) or suspicious activity report (SAR) is a type of report that a financial organization must submit to a financial regulator if they have reasonable grounds to suspect any financial transaction that has occurred or was attempted during their activities. There are stipulated timelines for filing these reports and it typically takes several hours of manual effort to create one report for one customer account.\nIn this post, we explore a solution that uses FMs available in Amazon Bedrock to create a draft STR. We cover how generative AI can be used to automate the manual process of draft generation using account information, transaction details, and correspondence summaries as well as creating a knowledge base of information about fraudulent entities involved in such transactions.\nSolution overview\nThe solution uses Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, Amazon Bedrock Agents, AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and OpenSearch Service. The workflow is as follows:\n\nThe user requests for creation of a draft STR report through the business application.\nThe application calls Amazon Bedrock Agents, which has been preconfigured with detailed instructions to engage in a conversational flow with the user. The agent follows these instructions to gather the required information from the user, completes the missing information by using actions groups to invoke the Lambda function, and generates the report in the specified format.\nFollowing its instructions, the agent invokes Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases to find details about fraudulent entities involved in the suspicious transactions.\nAmazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases queries OpenSearch Service to perform semantic search for the entities required for the report. If the information about fraudulent entities is available in Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, the agent follows its instructions to generate a report for the user.\nIf the information isn’t found in the knowledge base, the agent uses the chat interface to prompt the user to provide the website URL that contains the relevant information. Alternatively, the user can provide a description about the fraudulent entity in the chat interface.\nIf the user provides a URL for a publicly accessible website, the agent follows its instructions to call the action group to invoke a Lambda function to crawl the website URL. The Lambda function scrapes the information from the website and returns it to the agent for use in the report.\nThe Lambda function also stores the scraped content in an S3 bucket for future use by the search index.\nAmazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases can be programmed to periodically scan the S3 bucket to index the new content in OpenSearch Service.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the solution architecture and workflow.\n\nYou can use the full code available in GitHub to deploy the solution using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK). Alternatively, you can follow a step-by-step process for manual deployment. We walk through both approaches in this post.\nPrerequisites\nTo implement the solution provided in this post, you must enable model access in Amazon Bedrock for Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2 and Anthropic Claude 3.5 Haiku.\nDeploy the solution with the AWS CDK\nTo set up the solution using the AWS CDK, follow these steps:\n\nVerify that the AWS CDK has been installed in your environment. For installation instructions, refer to the AWS CDK Immersion Day Workshop.\nUpdate the AWS CDK to version 36.0.0 or higher:\n\n\nnpm install -g aws-cdk\n\n\nInitialize the AWS CDK environment in the AWS account:\n\n\ncdk bootstrap\n\n\nClone the GitHub repository containing the solution files:\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/aws-samples/suspicious-financial-transactions-reporting\n\n\nNavigate to the solution directory:\n\n\ncd financial-transaction-report-drafting-for-compliance\n\n\nCreate and activate the virtual environment:\n\n\npython3 -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n\nActivating the virtual environment differs based on the operating system. Refer to the AWS CDK workshop for information about activating in other environments.\n\nAfter the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies:\n\n\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n\nDeploy the backend and frontend stacks:\n\n\ncdk deploy -a ./app.py --all\n\n\nWhen the deployment is complete, check these deployed stacks by visiting the AWS CloudFormation console, as shown in the following two screenshots.\n\n\n\nManual deployment\nTo implement the solution without using the AWS CDK, complete the following steps:\n\nSet up an S3 bucket.\nCreate a Lambda function.\nSet up Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases.\nSet up Amazon Bedrock Agents.\n\nVisual layouts in some screenshots in this post might look different than those on your AWS Management Console.\nSet up an S3 bucket\nCreate an S3 bucket with a unique bucket name for the document repository, as shown in the following screenshot. This will be a data source for Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases.\n\nCreate the website scraper Lambda function\nCreate a new Lambda function called Url-Scraper using the Python 3.13 runtime to crawl and scrape the website URL provided by Amazon Bedrock Agents. The function will scrape the content, send the information to the agent, and store the contents in the S3 bucket for future references.\n\nError handling has been skipped in this code snippet for brevity. The full code is available in GitHub.\nCreate a new file called search_suspicious_party.py with the following code snippet:\n\nimport boto3\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport os\nimport re\nimport urllib.request\nBUCKET_NAME = os.getenv('S3_BUCKET')\ns3 = boto3.client('s3')\ndef get_receiving_entity_from_url(start_url):\n    response = urllib.request.urlopen(\n        urllib.request.Request(url=start_url, method='GET'),\n        timeout=5)\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.read(), 'html.parser')\n    # Extract page title\n    title = soup.title.string if soup.title else 'Untitled'\n    # Extract page content for specific HTML elements\n    content = ' '.join(p.get_text() for p in soup.find_all(['p', 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'h5', 'h6']))\n    content = re.sub(r'\\s+', ' ', content).strip()\n    s3.put_object(Body=content, Bucket=BUCKET_NAME, Key=f\"docs/{title}.txt\")\nreturn content\n\nReplace the default generated code in lambda_function.py with the following code:\n\nimport json\nfrom search-suspicious-party import *\ndef lambda_handler(event, context):\n    # apiPath should match the path specified in action group schema\n    if event['apiPath'] == '/get-receiving-entity-details':\n        # Extract the property from request data\n        start_url = get_named_property(event, 'start_url')\n        scraped_text = get_receiving_entity_from_url(start_url)\n        action_response = {\n            'actionGroup': event['actionGroup'],\n            'apiPath': event['apiPath'],\n            'httpMethod': event['httpMethod'],\n            'httpStatusCode': 200,\n            'responseBody': {\n                'application/json': {\n                    'body': json.dumps({'scraped_text': scraped_text})\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return {'response': action_response}\n    # Return an error if apiPath is not recognized\n    return {\n        'statusCode': 400,\n        'body': json.dumps({'error': 'Invalid API path'})\n    }\ndef get_named_property(event, name):\n    return next(\n        item for item in\n        event['requestBody']['content']['application/json']['properties']\n        if item['name'] == name\n    )['value']\n\nConfigure the Lambda function\nSet up a Lambda environment variable S3_BUCKET, as shown in the following screenshot. For Value, use the S3 bucket you created previously.\n\nIncrease the timeout duration for Lambda function to 30 seconds. You can adjust this value based on the time it takes for the crawler to complete its work.\n\nSet up Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases\nComplete the following steps to create a new knowledge base in Amazon Bedrock. This knowledge base will use OpenSearch Serverless to index the fraudulent entity data stored in Amazon S3. For more information, refer to Create a knowledge base by connecting to a data source in Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases.\n\nOn the Amazon Bedrock console, choose Knowledge bases in the navigation pane and choose Create knowledge base.\nFor Knowledge base name, enter a name (for example, str-knowledge-base).\nFor Service role name, keep the default system generated value.\n\n\n\nSelect Amazon S3 as the data source.\n\n\n\nConfigure the Amazon S3 data source: \n  \nFor Data source name, enter a name (for example, knowledge-base-data-source-s3).\nFor S3 URI, choose Browse S3 and choose the bucket where information scraped by web crawler about fraudulent entities is available for the knowledge base to use.\nKeep all other default values.\n \n\n\n\nFor Embeddings model, choose Titan Text Embeddings V2.\n\n\n\nFor Vector database, select Quick create a new vector store to create a default vector store with OpenSearch Serverless.\n\n\n\nReview the configurations and choose Create knowledge base.\n\nAfter the knowledge base is successfully created, you can see the knowledge base ID, which you will need when creating the agent in Amazon Bedrock.\n\nSelect knowledge-base-data-source-s3 from the list of data sources and choose Sync to index the documents.\n\n\nSet up Amazon Bedrock Agents\nTo create a new agent in Amazon Bedrock, complete the following steps. For more information, refer to Create and configure agent manually.\n\nOn the Amazon Bedrock console, choose Agents in the navigation pane and choose Create Agent.\nFor Name, enter a name (for example, agent-str).\nChoose Create.\n\n\n\nFor Agent resource role, keep the default setting (Create and use a new service role).\nFor Select model, choose a model provider and model name (for example, Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Haiku)\nFor Instructions for the Agent, provide the instructions that allow the agent to invoke the large language model (LLM).\n\nYou can download the instructions from the agent-instructions.txt file in the GitHub repo. Refer to next section in this post to understand how to write the instructions.\n\nKeep all other default values.\nChoose Save.\n\n\n\nUnder Action groups, choose Add to create a new action group.\n\n\nAn action is a task the agent can perform by making API calls. A set of actions comprises an action group.\n\nProvide an API schema that defines all the APIs in the action group.\nFor Action group details, enter an action group name (for example, agent-group-str-url-scraper).\nFor Action group type, select Define with API schemas.\nFor Action group invocation, select Select an existing Lambda function, which is the Lambda function that you created previously.\n\n\n\nFor Action group schema, choose Define via in-line schema editor.\nReplace the default sample code with the following example to define the schema to specify the input parameters with default and mandatory values:\n\n\nopenapi: 3.0.0\ninfo:\n  title: Gather suspicious receiving entity details from website\n  version: 1.0.0\npaths:\n  /:\n    post:\n      description: Get details about suspicious receiving entity from the URL\n      operationId: getReceivingEntityDetails\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: \"#/components/schemas/ScrapeRequest\"\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: Receiving entity details gathered successfully\ncomponents:\n  schemas:\n    ScrapeRequest:\n      type: object\n      properties:\n        :\n          type: string\n          description: The URL to start scraping from\n      required:\n        - start_url\n\n\nChoose Create.\nUnder Knowledge bases, choose Add.\n\n\n\nFor Select knowledge base, choose knowledge-base-str, which you created previously, and add the following instructions:\n\nUse the information in the knowledge-base-str knowledge base to select transaction reports.\n\n\nChoose Save to save all changes.\nFinally, choose Prepare to prepare this agent to get it ready for testing.\n\nYou can also create a Streamlit application to create a UI for this application. The source code is available in GitHub.\nAgent instructions\nAgent instructions for Amazon Bedrock Agents provide the mechanism for a multistep user interaction to gather the inputs an agent needs to invoke the LLM with a rich prompt to generate the response in the required format. Provide logical instructions in plain English. There are no predefined formats for these instructions.\n\nProvide an overview of the task including the role:\n\n\nYou are a financial user creating Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) draft for a financial compliance use case.\n\n\nProvide the message that the agent can use for initiating the user interaction:\n\n\nGreet the user with the message “Hi <name>. Welcome to STR report drafting. How can I help?”\nAsk the user to provide the transactions details. From the transaction details, capture the response in the <answer> tag and include the <thinking> tag to understand the rationale behind the response.\n\n\nSpecify the processing that needs to be done on the output received from the LLM:\n\n\nFor the transaction input provided by user, create a narrative description for financial risk reporting of the provided bank account and transaction details.\n1. Add a summary of correspondence logs that includes title, summary, correspondence history, and analysis in the narrative description.\n2. Add the details about the receiving entity in the narrative description. You can get details about receiving entities from the agent action group.\n\n\nProvide the optional messages that the agent can use for a multistep interaction to gather the missing inputs if required:\n\n\nIf you don't have knowledge about Receiving entity, you should ask the Human for more details about it with a message “Unfortunately I do not have enough context or details about the receiving entity <entity name> to provide an accurate risk assessment or summary. Can you please provide some additional background information about <entity name>? What is the URL of the <entity name> or the description?”\n\n\nSpecify the actions that the agent can take to process the user input using action groups:\n\n\nIf user provides the URL of <entity name>, call the action group <add action group name> to get the details. If user provides the description of <entity name>, then summarize and add it to the narrative description as a receiving entity.\n\n\nSpecify how the agent should provide the response, including the format details:\n\n\nOnce you have all the necessary input (financial transaction details and receiving entity details), create a detailed well-formatted draft report for financial risk reporting of the provided bank account and transaction details containing the following sections:\n1. Title\n2. Summary of transactions\n3. Correspondence History & Analysis\n4. Receiving entity summary\n\nTest the solution\nTo test the solution, follow these steps:\n\nChoose Test to start testing the agent.\nInitiate the chat and observe how the agent uses the instructions you provided in the configuration step to ask for required details for generating the report.\nTry different prompts, such as “Generate an STR for an account.”\n\nThe following screenshot shows an example chat.\n\nThe following screenshot shows an example chat with the prompt, “Generate an STR for account number 49179-180-2092803.”\n\nAnother option is to provide all the details at the same time, for example, “Generate an STR for account number 12345-999-7654321 with the following transactions.”\n\nCopy and paste the sample transactions from the sample-transactions.txt file in GitHub.\n\nThe agent keeps asking for missing information, such as account number, transaction details, and correspondence history. After it has all the details, it will generate a draft STR document.\nThe code in GitHub also contains a sample StreamLit application that you can use to test the application.\nClean up\nTo avoid incurring unnecessary future charges, clean up the resources you created as part of this solution. If you created the solution using the GitHub code sample and the AWS CDK, empty the S3 bucket and delete the CloudFormation stack. If you created the solution manually, complete the following steps:\n\nDelete the Amazon Bedrock agent.\nDelete the Amazon Bedrock knowledge base.\nEmpty and delete the S3 bucket if you created one specifically for this solution.\nDelete the Lambda function.\n\nConclusion\nIn this post, we showed how Amazon Bedrock offers a robust environment for building generative AI applications, featuring a range of advanced FMs. This fully managed service prioritizes privacy and security while helping developers create AI-driven applications efficiently. A standout feature, RAG, uses external knowledge bases to enrich AI-generated content with relevant information, backed by OpenSearch Service as its vector database. Additionally, you can include metadata fields in the knowledge base and agent session context with Amazon Verified Permissions to pass fine-grained access context for authorization.\nWith careful prompt engineering, Amazon Bedrock minimizes inaccuracies and makes sure that AI responses are grounded in factual documentation. This combination of advanced technology and data integrity makes Amazon Bedrock an ideal choice for anyone looking to develop reliable generative AI solutions. You can now explore extending this sample code to use Amazon Bedrock and RAG for reliably generating draft documents for compliance reporting.\n\nAbout the Authors\nDivyajeet (DJ) Singh is a Senior Solutions Architect at AWS Canada.

      "link": "https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/fine-tune-and-deploy-meta-llama-3-2-vision-for-generative-ai-powered-web-automation-using-aws-dlcs-amazon-eks-and-amazon-bedrock/",
      "description": "Fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a crucial technique for organizations seeking to adapt powerful foundation models (FMs) to their specific needs. Rather than training models from scratch—a process that can cost millions of dollars and require extensive computational resources—companies can customize existing models with domain-specific data at a fraction of the cost. This approach has become particularly valuable as organizations across healthcare, finance, and technology sectors look to use AI for specialized tasks while maintaining cost-efficiency. However, implementing a production-grade fine-tuning solution presents several significant challenges. Organizations must navigate complex infrastructure setup requirements, enforce robust security measures, optimize performance, and establish reliable model hosting solutions.\nIn this post, we present a complete solution for fine-tuning and deploying the Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct model for web automation tasks. We demonstrate how to build a secure, scalable, and efficient infrastructure using AWS Deep Learning Containers (DLCs) on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). By using AWS DLCs, you can gain access to well-tested environments that come with enhanced security features and pre-installed software packages, significantly simplifying the optimization of your fine-tuning process. This approach not only accelerates development, but also provides robust security and performance in production environments.\nSolution overview\nIn this section, we explore the key components of our architecture for fine-tuning a Meta Llama model and using it for web task automation. We explore the benefits of different components and how they interact with each other, and how we can use them to build a production-grade fine-tuning pipeline.\nAWS DLCs for training and hosting AI/ML workloads\nAt the core of our solution are AWS DLCs, which provide optimized environments for machine learning (ML) workloads. These containers come preconfigured with essential dependencies, including NVIDIA drivers, CUDA toolkit, and Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) support, along with preinstalled frameworks like PyTorch for model training and hosting. AWS DLCs tackle the complex challenge of packaging various software components to work harmoniously with training scripts, so you can use optimized hardware capabilities out of the box. Additionally, AWS DLCs implement unique patching algorithms and processes that continuously monitor, identify, and address security vulnerabilities, making sure the containers remain secure and up-to-date. Their pre-validated configurations significantly reduce setup time and reduce compatibility issues that often occur in ML infrastructure setup.\nAWS DLCs, Amazon EKS, and Amazon EC2 for seamless infrastructure management\nWe deploy these DLCs on Amazon EKS, creating a robust and scalable infrastructure for model fine-tuning. Organizations can use this combination to build and manage their training infrastructure with unprecedented flexibility. Amazon EKS handles the complex container orchestration, so you can launch training jobs that run within DLCs on your desired Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, producing a production-grade environment that can scale based on training demands while maintaining consistent performance.\nAWS DLCs and EFA support for high-performance networking\nAWS DLCs come with pre-configured support for EFA, enabling high-throughput, low-latency communication between EC2 nodes. An EFA is a network device that you can attach to your EC2 instance to accelerate AI, ML, and high performance computing applications. DLCs are pre-installed with EFA software that is tested and compatible with the underlying EC2 instances, so you don’t have to go through the hassle of setting up the underlying components yourself. For this post, we use setup scripts to create EKS clusters and EC2 instances that will support EFA out of the box.\nAWS DLCs with FSDP for enhanced memory efficiency\nOur solution uses PyTorch’s built-in support for Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) training, a cutting-edge technique that dramatically reduces memory requirements during training. Unlike traditional distributed training approaches where each GPU must hold a complete model copy, FSDP shards model parameters, optimizer states, and gradients across workers. The optimized implementation of FSDP within AWS DLCs makes it possible to train larger models with limited GPU resources while maintaining training efficiency.\nFor more information, see Scale LLMs with PyTorch 2.0 FSDP on Amazon EKS – Part 2.\nModel deployment on Amazon Bedrock\nFor model deployment, we use Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed service for FMs. Although we can use AWS DLCs for model hosting, we use Amazon Bedrock for this post to demonstrate diversity in service utilization.\nWeb automation integration\nFinally, we implement the SeeAct agent, a sophisticated web automation tool, and demonstrate its integration with our hosted model on Amazon Bedrock. This combination creates a powerful system capable of understanding visual inputs and executing complex web tasks autonomously, showcasing the practical applications of our fine-tuned model.In the following sections, we demonstrate how to:\n\nSet up an EKS cluster for AI workloads.\nUse AWS DLCs to fine-tune Meta Llama 3.2 Vision using PyTorch FSDP.\nDeploy the fine-tuned model on Amazon Bedrock.\nUse the model with SeeAct for web task automation.\n\nPrerequisites\nYou must have the following prerequisites:\n\nAn AWS account.\nAn AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with appropriate policies. Because this post deals with creating clusters, nodes, and infrastructure, administrator-level permissions would work well. However, if you must have restricted permissions, you should at least have the following permissions: AmazonEC2FullAccess, AmazonSageMakerFullAccess, AmazonBedrockFullAccess, AmazonS3FullAccess, AWSCloudFormationFullAccess, AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess. For more information about other IAM policies needed, see Minimum IAM policies.\nThe necessary dependencies installed for Amazon EKS. For instructions, see Set up to use Amazon EKS.\nFor this post, we use P5 instances. To request a quota increase, see Requesting a quota increase.\nAn EC2 key pair. For instructions, see Create a key pair for your Amazon EC2 instance.\n\nRun export AWS_REGION=<region_name> in your bash script from where you are running the commands.\nSet up the EKS cluster\nIn this section, we walk through the steps to create your EKS cluster and install the necessary plugins, operators, and other dependencies.\nCreate an EKS cluster\nThe simplest way to create an EKS cluster is to use the cluster configuration YAML file. You can use the following sample configuration file as a base and customize it as needed. Provide the EC2 key pair created as a prerequisite. For more configuration options, see Using Config Files.\n\n---\napiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5\nkind: ClusterConfig\n\nmetadata:\n  name: MyCluster\n  region: us-west-2\n\nmanagedNodeGroups: \n  - name: p5\n    instanceType: p5.48xlarge\n    minSize: 0\n    maxSize: 2\n    desiredCapacity: 2\n    availabilityZones: [\"us-west-2a\"]\n    volumeSize: 1024\n    ssh:\n      publicKeyName: <your-ec2-key-pair>\n    efaEnabled: true\n    privateNetworking: true\n    ## In case you have an On Demand Capacity Reservation (ODCR) and want to use it, uncomment the lines below.\n    # capacityReservation:\n    #   capacityReservationTarget:\n    #     capacityReservationResourceGroupARN: arn:aws:resource-groups:us-west-2:897880167187:group/eks_blog_post_capacity_reservation_resource_group_p5\n\nRun the following command to create the EKS cluster:\neksctl create cluster --config-file cluster.yamlThe following is an example output:\n\nYYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:SS [ℹ] eksctl version x.yyy.z\nYYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:SS [ℹ] using region <region_name>\n...\nYYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:SS [✔] EKS cluster \"<cluster_name>\" in \"<region_name>\" region is ready\n\nCluster creation might take between 15–30 minutes. After it’s created, your local ~/.kube/config file gets updated with connection information to your cluster.\nRun the following command line to verify that the cluster is accessible:\nkubectl get nodes\nInstall plugins, operators, and other dependencies\nIn this step, you install the necessary plugins, operators and other dependencies on your EKS cluster. This is necessary to run the fine-tuning on the correct node and save the model.\n\nInstall the NVIDIA Kubernetes device plugin:\n\n\nkubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin/v0.17.0/deployments/static/nvidia-device-plugin.yml\n\n\nInstall the AWS EFA Kubernetes device plugin:\n\n\nhelm repo add eks https://aws.github.io/eks-charts\ngit clone -b v0.0.190 https://github.com/aws/eks-charts.git\ncd  eks-charts/stable\nhelm install efa ./aws-efa-k8s-device-plugin -n kube-system\ncd ../..\n\n\nDelete aws-efa-k8s-device-plugin-daemonset by running the following command:\n\n\nkubectl delete daemonset aws-efa-k8s-device-plugin-daemonset -n kube-system\n\n\nClone the code locally that with help with setup and fine-tuning:\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-do-eks.git\ncd aws-do-eks\ngit checkout f59007ee50117b547305f3b8475c8e1b4db5a1d5\ncurl -L -o patch-aws-do-eks.tar.gz https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/raw/refs/heads/master/examples/dlc-llama-3-finetuning-and-hosting-with-agent/patch-aws-do-eks.tar.gz\nftar -xzf patch-aws-do-eks.tar.gz\ncd patch-aws-do-eks/\ngit am *.patch\ncd ../..\n\n\nInstall etcd for running distributed training with PyTorch:\n\n\nkubectl apply -f aws-do-eks/Container-Root/eks/deployment/etcd/etcd-deployment.yaml\n\n\nDeploy the FSx CSI driver for saving the model after fine-tuning: \n  \nEnter into the fsx folder: \n    \ncd aws-do-eks/Container-Root/eks/deployment/csi/fsx/\n \nEdit the fsx.conf file to modify the CLUSTER_NAME, CLUSTER_REGION, and CLUSTER_ZONE values to your cluster specific data: \n    \nvi fsx.conf\n \nDeploy the FSX CSI driver: \n    \n./deploy.sh\n \n \nDeploy the Kubeflow Training Operator that will be used to run the fine-tuning job: \n  \nChange the location to the following: \n    \ncd aws-do-eks/Container-Root/eks/deployment/kubeflow/training-operator/\n \nDeploy the Kubeflow Training Operator: \n    \n./deploy.sh\n \n \nDeploy the Kubeflow MPI Operator for running NCCL tests: \n  \nRun deploy.sh from the following GitHub repo.\nChange the location to the following: \n    \ncd aws-do-eks/Container-Root/eks/deployment/kubeflow/mpi-operator/\n \nDeploy the Kubeflow MPI Operator: \n    \n./deploy.sh\n \n \n\nFine-tune Meta Llama 3.2 Vision using DLCs on Amazon EKS\nThis section outlines the process for fine-tuning the Meta Llama 3.2 Vision model using PyTorch FSDP on Amazon EKS. We use the DLCs as the base image to run our training jobs.\nConfigure the setup needed for fine-tuning\nComplete the following steps to configure the setup for fine-tuning:\n\nCreate a Hugging Face account and get a Hugging Face security token.\nEnter into the fsdp folder:\n\n\ncd Container-Root/eks/deployment/distributed-training/pytorch/pytorchjob/fsdp\n\n\nCreate a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) that will use the underlying FSx CSI driver that you installed earlier:\n\n\nkubectl apply -f pvc.yaml\n\nMonitor kubectl get pvc fsx-claim and make sure it reached BOUND status. You can then go to the Amazon EKS console to see an unnamed volume created without a name. You can let this happen in the background, but before you run the ./run.sh command to run the fine-tuning job in a later step, make sure the BOUND status is achieved.\n\nTo configure the environment, open the .env file and modify the following variables: \n  \nHF_TOKEN: Add the Hugging Face token that you generated earlier.\nS3_LOCATION: Add the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) location where you want to store the fine-tuned model after the training is complete.\n \nCreate the required resource YAMLs:\n\n\n./deploy.sh\n\nThis line uses the values in the .env file to generate new YAML files that will eventually be used for model deployment.\n\nBuild and push the container image:\n\n\n./login-dlc.sh\n./build.sh\n./push.sh\n\nRun the fine-tuning job\nIn this step, we use the upstream DLCs and add the training scripts within the image for running the training.\nMake sure that you have requested access to the Meta Llama 3.2 Vision model on Hugging Face. Continue to the next step after permission has been granted.\nExecute the fine-tuning job:\n\n./run.sh\n\nFor our use case, the job took 1.5 hours to complete. The script uses the following PyTorch command that’s defined in the .env file within the fsdp folder:\n\n```\nbash\ntorchrun --nnodes 1 --nproc_per_node 8  \\\nrecipes/quickstart/finetuning/finetuning.py \\\n--enable_fsdp --lr 1e-5  --num_epochs 5 \\\n--batch_size_training 2 \\\n--model_name meta-llama/Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct \\\n--dist_checkpoint_root_folder ./finetuned_model \\\n--dist_checkpoint_folder fine-tuned  \\\n--use_fast_kernels \\\n--dataset \"custom_dataset\" --custom_dataset.test_split \"test\" \\\n--custom_dataset.file \"recipes/quickstart/finetuning/datasets/mind2web_dataset.py\"  \\\n--run_validation False --batching_strategy padding\n```\n\nYou can use the ./logs.sh command to see the training logs in both FSDP workers.\nAfter a successful run, logs from fsdp-worker will look as follows:\n\nSharded state checkpoint saved to /workspace/llama-recipes/finetuned_model_mind2web/fine-tuned-meta-llama/Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct\nCheckpoint Time = 85.3276\n\nEpoch 5: train_perplexity=1.0214, train_epoch_loss=0.0211, epoch time 706.1626197730075s\ntraining params are saved in /workspace/llama-recipes/finetuned_model_mind2web/fine-tuned-meta-llama/Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct/train_params.yaml\nKey: avg_train_prep, Value: 1.0532150745391846\nKey: avg_train_loss, Value: 0.05118955448269844\nKey: avg_epoch_time, Value: 716.0386156642023\nKey: avg_checkpoint_time, Value: 85.34336999000224\nfsdp-worker-1:78:5593 [0] NCCL INFO [Service thread] Connection closed by localRank 1\nfsdp-worker-1:81:5587 [0] NCCL INFO [Service thread] Connection closed by localRank 4\nfsdp-worker-1:85:5590 [0] NCCL INFO [Service thread] Connection closed by localRank 0\nI0305 19:37:56.173000 140632318404416 torch/distributed/elastic/agent/server/api.py:844] [default] worker group successfully finished.

Elapsed: 0.05295562744140625 seconds\n\n\n\nRun the processing model and store output in Amazon S3\nAfter the jobs are complete, the fine-tuned model will exist in the FSx file system. The next step is to convert the model into Hugging Face format and save it in Amazon S3 so you can access and deploy the model in the upcoming steps:kubectl apply -f model-processor.yaml\nThe preceding command deploys a pod on your instance that will read the model from FSx, convert it to Hugging Face type, and push it to Amazon S3. It takes approximately 8–10 minutes for this pod to run. You can monitor the logs for this using ./logs.sh or kubectl logs -l app=model-processor.\nGet the location where your model has been stored in Amazon S3. This is the same Amazon S3 location that was mentioned the .env file in an earlier step. Run the following command (provide the Amazon S3 location):aws s3 cp tokenizer_config.json <S3_LOCATION>://tokenizer_config.json\nThis is the tokenizer config that is needed by Amazon Bedrock to import Meta Llama models so they work with the Amazon Bedrock Converse API. For more details, see Converse API code samples for custom model import.\nFor this post, we use the Mind2Web dataset. We have implemented code that has been adapted from the Mind2Web code for fine-tuning. The adapted code is as follows:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-cookbook && \\\ncd llama-cookbook && \\\ngit checkout a346e19df9dd1a9cddde416167732a3edd899d09 && \\\ncurl -L -o patch-llama-cookbook.tar.gz https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/master/examples/dlc-llama-3-finetuning-and-hosting-with-agent/patch-llama-cookbook.tar.gz && \\\ntar -xzf patch-llama-cookbook.tar.gz && \\\ncd patch-llama-cookbook && \\\ngit config --global user.email \"you@example.com\" && \\\ngit am *.patch && \\\ncd .. && \\\ncat recipes/quickstart/finetuning/datasets/mind2web_dataset.py\n\nDeploy the fine-tuned model on Amazon Bedrock\nAfter you fine-tune your Meta Llama 3.2 Vision model, you have several options for deployment. This section covers one deployment method using Amazon Bedrock. With Amazon Bedrock, you can import and use your custom trained models seamlessly. Make sure your fine-tuned model is uploaded to an S3 bucket, and it’s converted to Hugging Face format. Complete the following steps to import your fine-tuned Meta Llama 3.2 Vision model:\n\nOn the Amazon Bedrock console, under Foundation models in the navigation pane, choose Imported models.\nChoose Import model.\nFor Model name, enter a name for the model.\n\n\n\nFor Model import source, select Amazon S3 bucket.\nFor S3 location, enter the location of the S3 bucket containing your fine-tuned model.\n\n\n\nConfigure additional model settings as needed, then import your model.\n\nThe process might take 10–15 minutes depending on the model size to complete.\nAfter you import your custom model, you can invoke it using the same Amazon Bedrock API as the default Meta Llama 3.2 Vision model. Just replace the model name with your imported model’s Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For detailed instructions, refer to Amazon Bedrock Custom Model Import.\nYou can follow the prompt formats mentioned in the following GitHub repo. For example:\nWhat are the steps to build a docker image?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nRun the agent workload using the hosted Amazon Bedrock model\nRunning the agent workload involves using the SeeAct framework and browser automation to start an interactive session with the AI agent and perform the browser operations. We recommend completing the steps in this section on a local machine for browser access.\nClone the SeeAct repository\nClone the customized SeeAct repository, which contains example code that can work with Amazon Bedrock, as well as a couple of test scripts:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/SeeAct.git\n\nSet up SeeAct in a local runtime environment\nComplete the following steps to set up SeeAct in a local runtime environment:\n\nCreate a Python virtual environment for this demo. We use Python 3.11 in the example, but you can change to other Python versions.\n\n\npython3.11 -m venv seacct-python-3-11\nsource seacct-python-3-11/bin/activate\n\n\nApply a patch to add the code change needed for this demo:\n\n\ncd SeeAct\ncurl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/master/examples/dlc-llama-3-finetuning-and-hosting-with-agent/patch-seeact.patch\ngit checkout 2fdbf373f58a1aa5f626f7c5931fe251afc69c0a\ngit apply patch-seeact.patch\n\n\nRun the following commands to install the SeeAct package and dependencies:\n\n\ncd SeeAct/seeact_package\npip install .\npip install -r requirements.txt\npip install -U boto3\nplaywright install\n\nMake sure you’re using the latest version of Boto3 for these steps.\nValidate the browser automation tool used by SeeAct\nWe added a small Python script to verify the functionality of Playwright, the browser automation tool used by SeeAct:\n\ncd SeeAct/src\npython test_playwright.py\n\nYou should see a browser launched and closed after a few seconds. You should also see a screenshot being captured in SeeAct/src/example.png showing google.com.\n\nTest Amazon Bedrock model availability\nModify the content of test_bedrock.py. Update the MODEL_ID to be your hosted Amazon Bedrock model ARN and set up the AWS connection.\n\nexport AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=\"replace with your aws credential\"\nexport AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=\"replace with your aws credential\"\nexport AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=\"replace with your aws credential\"\n\nRun the test:\n\ncd SeeAct\npython test_bedrock.py\n\nAfter a successful invocation, you should see a log similar to the following in your terminal:\n\nThe image shows a dog lying down inside a black pet carrier, with a leash attached to the dog's collar.\n\nIf the botocore.errorfactory.ModelNotReadyException error occurs, retry the command in a few minutes.\nRun the agent workflow\nThe branch has already added support for BedrockEngine and SGLang for running inference with the fine-tuned Meta Llama 3.2 Vision model. The default option uses Amazon Bedrock inference.\nTo run the agent workflow, update self.model from src/demo_utils/inference_engine.py at line 229 to your Amazon Bedrock model ARN. Then run the following code:\n\ncd SeeAct/src\npython seeact.py -c config/demo_mode.toml \n\nThis will launch a terminal prompt like the following code, so you can input the task you want the agent to do:\n\nPlease input a task, and press Enter. \nOr directly press Enter to use the default task: Find pdf of paper \"GPT-4V(ision) is a Generalist Web Agent, if Grounded\" from arXiv\nTask: \n\nIn the following screenshot, we asked the agent to search for the website for DLCs.\n\nClean up\nUse the following code to clean the resources you created as part of this post:\n\ncd Container-Root/eks/deployment/distributed-training/pytorch/pytorchjob/fsdp\nkubectl delete -f ./fsdp.yaml ## Deletes the training fsdp job\nkubectl delete -f ./etcd.yaml ## Deletes etcd\nkubectl delete -f ./model-processor.yaml ## Deletes model processing YAML\n\ncd aws-do-eks/Container-Root/eks/deployment/kubeflow/mpi-operator/\n./remove.sh\n\ncd aws-do-eks/Container-Root/eks/deployment/kubeflow/training-operator/\n./remove.sh\n\n## [VOLUME GETS DELETED] - If you want to delete the FSX volume\nkubectl delete -f ./pvc.yaml ## Deletes persistent volume claim, persistent volume and actual volume\n\nTo stop the P5 nodes and release them, complete the following steps:\n\nOn the Amazon EKS console, choose Clusters in the navigation pane.\nChoose the cluster that contains your node group.\nOn the cluster details page choose the Compute tab.\nIn the Node groups section, select your node group, then choose Edit.\nSet the desired size to 0.\n\nConclusion\nIn this post, we presented an end-to-end workflow for fine-tuning and deploying the Meta Llama 3.2 Vision model using the production-grade infrastructure of AWS. By using AWS DLCs on Amazon EKS, you can create a robust, secure, and scalable environment for model fine-tuning. The integration of advanced technologies like EFA support and FSDP training enables efficient handling of LLMs while optimizing resource usage. The deployment through Amazon Bedrock provides a streamlined path to production, and the integration with SeeAct demonstrates practical applications in web automation tasks. This solution serves as a comprehensive reference point for engineers to develop their own specialized AI applications, adapt the demonstrated approaches, and implement similar solutions for web automation, content analysis, or other domain-specific tasks requiring vision-language capabilities.\nTo get started with your own implementation, refer to our GitHub repo.

      "description": "This post is co-written with Abhinav Pandey from Nippon Life India Asset Management Ltd.\nAccurate information retrieval through generative AI-powered assistants is a popular use case for enterprises. To reduce hallucination and improve overall accuracy, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) remains the most commonly used method to retrieve reliable and accurate responses that use enterprise data when responding to user queries. RAG is used for use cases such as AI assistants, search, real-time insights, and improving overall content quality by using the relevant data to generate the response, thereby reducing hallucinations.\nAmazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases provides a managed RAG experience that can be used for many use cases. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases is a fully managed service that does the heavy lifting of implementing a RAG pattern—including data ingestion, data chunking, data embedding, and query matching. Amazon Bedrock offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies such as AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, Stability AI, and Amazon through a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities to build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI. Using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, you can create a RAG solution quickly and seamlessly.\nHowever, in a large enterprise scenario with a large number of relevant documents, the final response is generated based on only the top 5 or top 10 results provided by the database. Because RAG uses a similarity match and not an exact match, there is a possibility that the most relevant result won’t be in the top results returned by the database. In such scenarios, the regular RAG pattern might not be highly accurate.\nIn this post, we examine a solution adopted by Nippon Life India Asset Management Limited that improves the accuracy of the response over a regular (naive) RAG approach by rewriting the user queries and aggregating and reranking the responses. The proposed solution uses enhanced RAG methods such as reranking to improve the overall accuracy.\nLimitations and workarounds in naive RAG for a large volume of documents\nThe following are the primary limitations with naive RAG when using it with a large volume of documents:\n\nAccuracy – As the documents grow in number or size, the final list of extracted chunks might miss some relevant sections or documents because of the limited number of documents returned\nParsing complex structures – Entities such as nested tables, images, and graphs are not parsed accurately\nLimited use of relevant data – As the dataset grows, only the configured set of top results are used for context, impacting accuracy\nResponding to complex questions – Compound questions (such as a question with multiple sub-questions) pose challenges to the RAG solution\nRetrieving the correct context – Documents such as legal documents or technical manuals have semantically related sections on different pages, impacting the overall accuracy\nAvoiding hallucinations – Models must generate complete, correct, and grounded responses without hallucinations\n\nTo address these challenges, developers usually adopt a combination of the following workarounds:\n\nProgrammatic parsing – Use another service (such as Amazon Textract) to extract the table content into a markdown (.MD) file.\nProgrammatic split of compound questions – Programmatically split the question or reformulate the question and get the responses and then programmatically aggregate the response.\nProgrammatic chunking – Programmatically create custom chunks of the documents and manage them in a vector store.\n\nSolution overview\nIn this section, we review the basics of RAG, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, and advanced RAG methods to address the preceding challenges. The following table details the specific solution components adopted by Nippon to overcome the challenges we discussed in the previous section.\n\n\n\nNaive RAG Challenges\nHow Nippon Addressed These Challenges\n\n\nLower accuracy due to high volume of documents\nUse Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases with advanced RAG methods, including semantic chunking, multi-query RAG, and results reranking\n\n\nParsing complex document structure such as nested tables and graphs within documents\nUse Amazon Textract to parse the documents into markdown files\n\n\nHandling compound questions\nUse query reformulation and results reranking to get the relevant results\n\n\nRetrieving current context from the documents\nUse semantic chunking in Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases\n\n\nGenerating grounded responses without any hallucination\nUse Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases RAG evaluation\n\n\n\nIn the next few sections, we detail each of the solution components. We start with an overview of RAG and then discuss Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases. We then discuss advanced RAG methods adopted by Nippon, including advanced parsing, query reformulation, multi-query RAG, and results reranking.\nRAG overview\nThe RAG pattern for this solution has two primary workflows: a data ingestion workflow and a text generation phase, as depicted in the following figure. During the ingestion phase, the solution chunks the content of the source documents, creates embeddings for the created chunks, and stores them in a vector database. In the text generation workflow, the user query is converted to a vector embedding and the query embedding is compared with embeddings stored in the vector database. The database provides the top results that are close to the user query. The solution then sends the user query along with the retrieved top results as the context to the FM, which then provides the final response. Because the responses are based on the relevant contextual enterprise data, this solution reduces hallucinations.\n\n\nIngestion & Text generation workflows\n\nYou can implement this solution using AWS services as shown in the following figure.\n\n\nRAG implementation using AWS services\n\nThe following is a typical RAG-based AI assistant flow.The first series of steps, as numbered in the preceding diagram, augment the user query using a knowledge base:\n\nUser queries are served by Amazon Lex hosted on Amazon CloudFront.\nThe business logic for the AI assistant can run on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), or AWS Lambda.\nYou can manage the conversation history or state in Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility), or Amazon MemoryDB.\nThe user query and the earlier conversation history are sent to the Amazon Bedrock embedding model.\nUser prompts are compared to earlier prompts cached in MemoryDB. If the user prompt matches a stored prompt, the stored prompt result is retrieved and sent to the user.\nIf there’s no match for the user prompt in the cache, the vector database (such as Amazon OpenSearch, Amazon Aurora, Amazon Kendra, MemoryDB, DocumentDB, or Amazon Neptune) is searched for the query embedding. The relevant knowledge or Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) path to the relevant image or video is retrieved.\nThe relevant knowledge, image, or video is retrieved from the Amazon S3 path.\nThe multimodal large language model (LLM) in Amazon Bedrock uses the query results to create a final response.\nThe new answer is stored in the database cache.\nThe final response is sent to the user.\n\nThe workflow to create and maintain the knowledge base is shown in the previous diagram:\n\nThe data is ingested from structured and unstructured sources such as a file system, emails, or multi-media content.\nThe data is ingested into Amazon S3 in batches or in real time using services such as AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS), Amazon Kinesis, Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK), Amazon AppFlow, or AWS Glue.\nThe data is processed through AWS Glue, Amazon SageMaker processing, or Amazon EMR.\nAn embeddings LLM from Amazon Bedrock generates the embeddings for the content chunks.\nThe embeddings are stored in the vector database.\n\nAmazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases\nAmazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases provides managed RAG, which does the heavy lifting of the core activities in the data ingestion and text generation workflows. Nippon uses Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases for implementing the RAG pattern. The following figure shows the fully managed data ingestion workflow provided by Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases. You can choose the data source from which data of various formats can be incrementally updated. For content chunking, you can choose from the following strategies: fixed, semantic, or hierarchical. You can also choose the embedding models and vector store.\n\n\nData ingestion flow\n\nThe following table compares various chunking strategies. You can also author a custom chunking strategy using Lambda.\n\n\n\nChunking strategy\nDetails\nAdvantages\n\n\nFixed chunking\n\n\nFixed character count division\nRecursive character text splitting\n \nQuick and efficient\n\n\nSemantic chunking (used by Nippon)\n\n\nMeaningful and complete chunks based on semantic similarity\n \nBetter retrieval quality\n\n\nHierarchical chunking\n\n\nOrganize chunks in a structured manner\nNodes with summaries and parent-child relationships\n \nImproved retrieval efficiency and reliability\n\n\n\nNippon uses semantic chunking because the documents have sections with semantic similarity. During the text generation workflow, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases creates embeddings from the user input and performs semantic search in the Amazon Bedrock knowledge base. The retrieved results from the context are augmented with a prompt for the LLM to generate the final response as shown in the following figure.\n\n\nRAG Flow\n\nAdvanced RAG methods adopted by Nippon\nIn this section, we review the key advanced RAG methods used in the Nippon AI assistant solution.\nAdvanced parsing and chunking\nA complex document with tables, images, and graphs poses challenges in RAG because the default fixed chunking often loses the context. For these scenarios, Nippon uses the following approaches:\n\nParse the document with Amazon Textract – Nippon uses Amazon Textract—which excels at understanding complex structures like tables—to extract the details from the document into a markdown file (.MD).\nParse the document with an FM with specific instructions – In this approach, Nippon uses an FM that has specific parsing instructions to extract the details from the document. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases provides LLMs along with instructions for parsing the documents.\nParse the document using third-party parsers – This approach uses third-party parsers such as open source document parsers and then indexed the parsed content.\n\nAfter the documents are parsed, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases chunks the data. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases provides fixed chunking, semantic chunking, and hierarchical chunking strategies. You can also add custom chunking using Lambda functions for specific documents.\nQuery reformulation\nIf the user queries are complex, the overall accuracy of the RAG solution decreases because it can be difficult to understand all the nuances of the complex question. In such cases, you can split the complex question into multiple sub-questions for improved accuracy. Nippon used an LLM to split the compound query into multiple sub-queries. The search results for each of the sub-queries are returned simultaneously and are then ranked and combined. The LLM uses the combined data to provide the final response, as shown in the following figure.\n\n\nQuery reformulation\n\nMulti-query RAG\nIn the multi-query RAG approach, you can reformulate the question into different variants (Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases provides automatic query reformulation) and execute the queries in parallel. You then summarize the results of those queries and rerank them to get the final response as shown in the following figure.\n\n\nMulti-query RAG\n\nNippon uses the initial question and break it into n sub-questions using our choice of LLM (Anthropic’s Claude3 Sonnet on Amazon Bedrock). With this implementation, the quality of our responses has improved, and the query is answered in greater depth. Because this requires additional processing, the response time is slightly longer, which is justified by the quality of the response.\nResults reranking\nIn a typical enterprise scenario where you have a large volume of documents, the ranking of the results might not be correct and accuracy could be reduced. For example, the default results returned from a vector database will be based on vector similarity criteria whose rank might not be accurate or relevant based on the user’s conversation history or the query context. In such scenarios, you can use another FM to look closely at the results and reorder them based on analysis of the context, relevance, and other criteria. After the results are reranked, you can be certain that the top results are highly relevant to the user context. Each document or search result is assigned a score based on criteria such as semantic similarity, contextual alignment, or domain-specific features, thereby increasing the overall accuracy of the final response, reducing hallucination, and improving user satisfaction. The key reranker strategies are:\n\nCross-encoder reranking – Uses models specifically trained to assess the relevance between query-document pairs\nHybrid reranking – Combines multiple signals such as vector similarity, keyword matching, recency, and so on\nMulti-stage retrieval – Retrieves a larger set using faster methods, then applies more computationally intensive reranking on a subset\n\nAmazon Bedrock provides reranker models that calculate the relevance of the chunks for a given query, assigns a score for the chunk, and reorders the results based on the score. By using a reranker model in Amazon Bedrock, you can get highly relevant chunks in the search results, improving the overall response accuracy. Nippon has combined query reformulation with results reranking to improve the overall accuracy of the RAG solution using the Amazon Bedrock reranker models.\nMetrics for RAG Evaluation\nBecause RAG solutions have multiple moving parts, you need to evaluate them against key success metrics to make sure that you get relevant and contextual data from the knowledge base. RAG evaluation should validate the generation of complete, correct, and grounded answers without hallucinations. You also need to evaluate the bias, safety, and trust of RAG solutions.\nAmazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases provides built-in support for RAG evaluation, including quality metrics such as correctness, completeness, and faithfulness (hallucination detection); responsible AI metrics such as harmfulness, answer refusal, and stereotyping; and compatibility with Amazon Bedrock Guardrails. Nippon used RAG evaluation to compare against multiple evaluation jobs using custom datasets.\nNippon is currently evaluating additional techniques, including GraphRAG, metadata filtering, and agentic AI. We have briefly summarized the capabilities being evaluated at Nippon in the following sections.\nGraphRAG\nFor applications that need to establish relationships with data that are hierarchically related (such as knowledge management, enterprise search, recommendation systems, and so on), Nippon uses a graph database instead of a vector database. GraphRAG applications use rich and interconnected entity relationships to identify the dependencies and excel in querying multi-dimensional relationships that further boost the context for FMs. In addition, with graph databases, Nippon can efficiently query and traverse the data, and their schema enables them to accommodate dynamic content. The graph databases help the FMs better understand the semantic relationship, uncover hidden patterns, adapt to dynamic knowledge bases, and provide better reasonability.\nAmazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases supports fully managed GraphRAG, which uses the Amazon Neptune graph database.\nMetadata filtering\nIn a few use cases, you might need to filter the documents in a knowledge base based on specific metadata values. For instance, government regulatory bodies release regulatory guidelines frequently, often with the same document names and only minor variations in the regulatory clauses. When your query is about a specific regulation, you want the most recent document to be returned. In such cases, you can rank the documents based on their modified date. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases provide custom metadata as filters (such as modified date) to improve the quality of search results.\nAmazon Bedrock Agents\nWith Amazon Bedrock Agents, you can orchestrate multi-step business processes using tools and information sources. Nippon is currently evaluating the latest FMs in Amazon Bedrock Agents for their AI assistant use case.\nSolution flow\nThe following diagram shows the end-to-end flow of the Nippon AI assistant solution.\n\n\nEnd-to-end flow of the Nippon AI assistant solution\n\nThe data ingestion workflow consists of the following steps:\n\nThe documents from the data source are prepared for ingestion.\nNippon uses custom parsing to extract the relevant details from complex elements like tables, graphs, and images. They use custom chunking to create the chunks.\nThey use an embedding model from Amazon Bedrock to convert the content chunks to vector embeddings and store them in the vector database.\n\nThe content generation workflow is as follows:\n\nThe user’s query is converted into embeddings by the Amazon Bedrock embedding model.\nNippon uses multi-query RAG by creating multiple variants of the query and executing them in parallel. The obtained results are reranked using a reranker model for higher accuracy.\nThe prompt is augmented with the references from the source documents to create citations\nThe augmented prompt is sent to Amazon Bedrock.\nAmazon Bedrock creates and sends the final response to the user.\n\nNippon plans to use agentic AI implementation in the future for automating the data retrieval, indexing, and ingestion.\nResults\nNippon saw the following improvements after implementing RAG:\n\nAccuracy was increased by more than 95%\nHallucination was reduced by 90–95%\nThey were able to add source chunks and file links (through file metadata), which improves the user confidence in the response\nThe time needed to generate a report was reduced from 2 days to approximately 10 minutes\n\nSummary\nIn this post, we discussed RAG and some of the challenges associated with processing large volumes of documents. We explained the advanced RAG methods used in the Nippon AI assistant, including enhanced parsing using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases and third-party models. In addition, we explained query reformulation and multi-query RAG techniques—such as generating multiple queries, reranking results, using GraphRAG, and applying metadata filtering. Finally, we described the end-to-end solution implemented for the Nippon AI assistant. These methods are generally available and are not built by or belong only to Nippon.\nExplore Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases for RAG use cases by using advanced RAG features such as FM as a parser, query reformulation, reranker models, GraphRAG, and others to implement highly accurate RAG solutions. You can also use Amazon Bedrock Guardrails to build responsible AI solutions by enforcing content and image safeguards and enabling automated reasoning checks.\nPlease note that RAG methods mentioned in the blog are generally available to all and are not built by or belong only to Nippon. \n\nAbout the authors\nShailesh Shivakumar is an FSI Sr. Solutions Architect with AWS India.

      "description": "Drug discovery is a complex, time-intensive process that requires researchers to navigate vast amounts of scientific literature, clinical trial data, and molecular databases. Life science customers like Genentech and AstraZeneca are using AI agents and other generative AI tools to increase the speed of scientific discovery. Builders at these organizations are already using the fully managed features of Amazon Bedrock to quickly deploy domain-specific workflows for a variety of use cases, from early drug target identification to healthcare provider engagement.\nHowever, more complex use cases might benefit from using the open source Strands Agents SDK. Strands Agents takes a model-driven approach to develop and run AI agents. It works with most model providers, including custom and internal large language model (LLM) gateways, and agents can be deployed where you would host a Python application.\nIn this post, we demonstrate how to create a powerful research assistant for drug discovery using Strands Agents and Amazon Bedrock. This AI assistant can search multiple scientific databases simultaneously using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), synthesize its findings, and generate comprehensive reports on drug targets, disease mechanisms, and therapeutic areas. This assistant is available as an example in the open-source healthcare and life sciences agent toolkit for you to use and adapt.\nSolution overview\nThis solution uses Strands Agents to connect high-performing foundation models (FMs) with common life science data sources like arXiv, PubMed, and ChEMBL. It demonstrates how to quickly create MCP servers to query data and view the results in a conversational interface.\nSmall, focused AI agents that work together can often produce better results than a single, monolithic agent. This solution uses a team of sub-agents, each with their own FM, instructions, and tools. The following flowchart shows how the orchestrator agent (shown in orange) handles user queries and routes them to sub-agents for either information retrieval (green) or planning, synthesis, and report generation (purple).\n\nThis post focuses on building with Strands Agents in your local development environment. Refer to the Strands Agents documentation to deploy production agents on AWS Lambda, AWS Fargate, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), or Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2).\nIn the following sections, we show how to create the research assistant in Strands Agents by defining an FM, MCP tools, and sub-agents.\nPrerequisites\nThis solution requires Python 3.10+, strands-agents, and several additional Python packages. We strongly recommend using a virtual environment like venv or uv to manage these dependencies.\nComplete the following steps to deploy the solution to your local environment:\n\nClone the code repository from GitHub.\nInstall the required Python dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt.\nConfigure your AWS credentials by setting them as environment variables, adding them to a credentials file, or following another supported process.\nSave your Tavily API key to a .env file in the following format: TAVILY_API_KEY=\"YOUR_API_KEY\".\n\nYou also need access to the following Amazon Bedrock FMs in your AWS account:\n\nAnthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet\nAnthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet\nAnthropic’s Claude 3.5 Haiku\n\nDefine the foundation model\nWe start by defining a connection to an FM in Amazon Bedrock using the Strands Agents BedrockModel class. We use Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet as the default model. See the following code:\n\nfrom strands import Agent, tool\nfrom strands.models import BedrockModel\nfrom strands.agent.conversation_manager import SlidingWindowConversationManager\nfrom strands.tools.mcp import MCPClient\n# Model configuration with Strands using Amazon Bedrock's foundation models\ndef get_model():\n    model = BedrockModel(\n        boto_client_config=Config(\n            read_timeout=900,\n            connect_timeout=900,\n            retries=dict(max_attempts=3, mode=\"adaptive\"),\n        ),\n        model_id=\"us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0\",\n        max_tokens=64000,\n        temperature=0.1,\n        top_p=0.9,\n        additional_request_fields={\n            \"thinking\": {\n                \"type\": \"disabled\"  # Can be enabled for reasoning mode\n            }\n        }\n    )\n    return model\n\nDefine MCP tools\nMCP provides a standard for how AI applications interact with their external environments. Thousands of MCP servers already exist, including those for life science tools and datasets. This solution provides example MCP servers for:\n\narXiv – Open-access repository of scholarly articles\nPubMed – Peer-reviewed citations for biomedical literature\nChEMBL – Curated database of bioactive molecules with drug-like properties\nClinicalTrials.gov – US government database of clinical research studies\nTavily Web Search – API to find recent news and other content from the public internet\n\nStrands Agents streamlines the definition of MCP clients for our agent. In this example, you connect to each tool using standard I/O. However, Strands Agents also supports remote MCP servers with Streamable-HTTP Events transport. See the following code:\n\n# MCP Clients for various scientific databases\ntavily_mcp_client = MCPClient(lambda: stdio_client(\n    StdioServerParameters(command=\"python\", args=[\"application/mcp_server_tavily.py\"])\n))\narxiv_mcp_client = MCPClient(lambda: stdio_client(\n    StdioServerParameters(command=\"python\", args=[\"application/mcp_server_arxiv.py\"])\n))\npubmed_mcp_client = MCPClient(lambda: stdio_client(\n    StdioServerParameters(command=\"python\", args=[\"application/mcp_server_pubmed.py\"])\n))\nchembl_mcp_client = MCPClient(lambda: stdio_client(\n    StdioServerParameters(command=\"python\", args=[\"application/mcp_server_chembl.py\"])\n))\nclinicaltrials_mcp_client = MCPClient(lambda: stdio_client(\n    StdioServerParameters(command=\"python\", args=[\"application/mcp_server_clinicaltrial.py\"])\n))\n\nDefine specialized sub-agents\nThe planning agent looks at user questions and creates a plan for which sub-agents and tools to use:\n\n@tool\ndef planning_agent(query: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    A specialized planning agent that analyzes the research query and determines\n    which tools and databases should be used for the investigation.\n    \"\"\"\n    planning_system = \"\"\"\n    You are a specialized planning agent for drug discovery research. Your role is to:\n    \n    1. Analyze research questions to identify target proteins, compounds, or biological mechanisms\n    2. Determine which databases would be most relevant (Arxiv, PubMed, ChEMBL, ClinicalTrials.gov)\n    3. Generate specific search queries for each relevant database\n    4. Create a structured research plan\n    \"\"\"\n    model = get_model()\n    planner = Agent(\n        model=model,\n        system_prompt=planning_system,\n    )\n    response = planner(planning_prompt)\n    return str(response)\n\nSimilarly, the synthesis agent integrates findings from multiple sources into a single, comprehensive report:\n\n@tool\ndef synthesis_agent(research_results: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Specialized agent for synthesizing research findings into a comprehensive report.\n    \"\"\"\n    system_prompt = \"\"\"\n    You are a specialized synthesis agent for drug discovery research. Your role is to:\n    \n    1. Integrate findings from multiple research databases\n    2. Create a comprehensive, coherent scientific report\n    3. Highlight key insights, connections, and opportunities\n    4. Organize information in a structured format:\n       - Executive Summary (300 words)\n       - Target Overview\n       - Research Landscape\n       - Drug Development Status\n       - References\n    \"\"\"\n    model = get_model()\n    synthesis = Agent(\n        model=model,\n        system_prompt=system_prompt,\n    )\n    response = synthesis(synthesis_prompt)\n    return str(response)\n\nDefine the orchestration agent\nWe also define an orchestration agent to coordinate the entire research workflow. This agent uses the SlidingWindowConversationManager class from Strands Agents to store the last 10 messages in the conversation. See the following code:\n\ndef create_orchestrator_agent(\n    history_mode,\n    tavily_client=None,\n    arxiv_client=None,\n    pubmed_client=None,\n    chembl_client=None,\n    clinicaltrials_client=None,\n):\n    system = \"\"\"\n    You are an orchestrator agent for drug discovery research. Your role is to coordinate a multi-agent workflow:\n    \n    1. COORDINATION PHASE:\n       - For simple queries: Answer directly WITHOUT using specialized tools\n       - For complex research requests: Initiate the multi-agent research workflow\n    \n    2. PLANNING PHASE:\n       - Use the planning_agent to determine which databases to search and with what queries\n    \n    3. EXECUTION PHASE:\n       - Route specialized search tasks to the appropriate research agents\n    \n    4. SYNTHESIS PHASE:\n       - Use the synthesis_agent to integrate findings into a comprehensive report\n       - Generate a PDF report when appropriate\n    \"\"\"\n    # Aggregate all tools from specialized agents and MCP clients\n    tools = [planning_agent, synthesis_agent, generate_pdf_report, file_write]\n    # Dynamically load tools from each MCP client\n    if tavily_client:\n        tools.extend(tavily_client.list_tools_sync())\n    # ... (similar for other clients)\n    conversation_manager = SlidingWindowConversationManager(\n        window_size=10,  # Maintains context for the last 10 exchanges\n    )\n    orchestrator = Agent(\n        model=model,\n        system_prompt=system,\n        tools=tools,\n        conversation_manager=conversation_manager\n    )\n    return orchestrator\n\nExample use case: Explore recent breast cancer research\nTo test out the new assistant, launch the chat interface by running streamlit run application/app.py and opening the local URL (typically http://localhost:8501) in your web browser. The following screenshot shows a typical conversation with the research agent. In this example, we ask the assistant, “Please generate a report for HER2 including recent news, recent research, related compounds, and ongoing clinical trials.” The assistant first develops a comprehensive research plan using the various tools at its disposal. It decides to start with a web search for recent news about HER2, as well as scientific articles on PubMed and arXiv. It also looks at HER2-related compounds in ChEMBL and ongoing clinical trials. It synthesizes these results into a single report and generates an output file of its findings, including citations.\n\nThe following is an excerpt of a generated report:\n\nComprehensive Scientific Report: HER2 in Breast Cancer Research and Treatment\n1. Executive Summary\nHuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) continues to be a critical target in breast cancer research and treatment development. This report synthesizes recent findings across the HER2 landscape highlighting significant advances in understanding HER2 biology and therapeutic approaches. The emergence of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represents a paradigm shift in HER2-targeted therapy, with trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd, Enhertu) demonstrating remarkable efficacy in both early and advanced disease settings. The DESTINY-Breast11 trial has shown clinically meaningful improvements in pathologic complete response rates when T-DXd is followed by standard therapy in high-risk, early-stage HER2+ breast cancer, potentially establishing a new treatment paradigm.\n\nNotably, you don’t have to define a step-by-step process to accomplish this task. By providing the assistant with a well-documented list of tools, it can decide which to use and in what order.\nClean up\nIf you followed this example on your local computer, you will not create new resources in your AWS account that you need to clean up. If you deployed the research assistant using one of those services, refer to the relevant service documentation for cleanup instructions.\nConclusion\nIn this post, we showed how Strands Agents streamlines the creation of powerful, domain-specific AI assistants. We encourage you to try this solution with your own research questions and extend it with new scientific tools. The combination of Strands Agents’s orchestration capabilities, streaming responses, and flexible configuration with the powerful language models of Amazon Bedrock creates a new paradigm for AI-assisted research. As the volume of scientific information continues to grow exponentially, frameworks like Strands Agents will become essential tools for drug discovery.\nTo learn more about building intelligent agents with Strands Agents, refer to Introducing Strands Agents, an Open Source AI Agents SDK, Strands Agents SDK, and the GitHub repository.

      "link": "https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-nova-act-sdk-preview-path-to-production-for-browser-automation-agents/",
      "description": "In early 2025, we introduced the Amazon Nova Act SDK as a research preview to help developers build agents that reliably complete tasks in a web browser. Now, we are excited to work with customers to take their agents to production in a limited preview, using new AWS integrations including AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for secure credentialing, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) for data storage and policy control, and the new Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser Tool for scalable, cloud-based browser execution.\nIn this post, we walk through what makes the Amazon Nova Act SDK unique, how it works, and how teams across industries are already using it to automate browser-based workflows at scale.\nChallenges with traditional automated business workflows\nMany day-to-day business operations require a browser, such as submitting time-off requests, processing invoices, accessing vendor portals, or reviewing dashboards. Lack of API coverage often means workflows are done manually: teams copy-paste data across tabs, follow multi-step flows, and click through countless interfaces to get work done.\nTraditional rules-based browser automation frameworks often face challenges in dynamic web environments. Teams can spend more time on ongoing maintenance than on building new automations, because changes in page structure (for example, newly added form fields or dropdown options) break brittle selectors. Most importantly, these frameworks are difficult to scale. If one use case is performed on 50 different sites (for example, professional license verification on state websites), teams must build 50 site-specific automations, because rules-based frameworks don’t generalize.\nAs humans, our ability to perform tasks adapts across different tools and interfaces. For example, once you know how to draft an email in Outlook, you can easily do the same in Gmail—even if you’ve never used it before. Large language models (LLMs), trained on millions of examples of UIs, offer the potential to create a similar type of pattern recognition for AI agents. They’ve brought us this far—powering chat, summarization, coding copilots, and more—by interpreting language, following instructions, and reasoning across domains. Now, we’re entering the next phase of generative AI: one centered on action. Agentic AI builds on the foundation of LLMs to move from understanding to execution. These systems are designed to complete dynamic, multi-step workflows—like filling out complex forms, interacting with evolving UI elements, or performing real-world business tasks at scale. Agentic AI doesn’t replace LLMs—it extends them, unlocking new automation capabilities that bring us closer to real task completion in enterprise environments.\nAgentic AI with the Amazon Nova Act SDK\nWith the Amazon Nova Act SDK, you can build and deploy reliable browser agents powered by the Amazon Nova Act model—purpose-built and fine-tuned for agentic AI. Trained with reinforcement learning and extensive in-domain browser interaction data, it executes step-by-step workflows with precision. With this latest version, we’ve extended those capabilities with AWS integrations so you can take your agents from prototype to production. You can install the SDK with a single command, write agents in Python and natural language, debug in real time, and integrate directly into continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. With enterprise-grade security, observability, and infrastructure now available through AWS, the Amazon Nova Act SDK provides a fast, flexible path for teams looking to build agents that act—and deliver—at scale. You can use the Amazon Nova Act SDK to automate real-world workflows where traditional scripts or general-purpose models aren’t reliable or scalable enough. You can install it with a single command, write agents using a combination of Python and natural language, debug while the workflow runs, and deploy through CI/CD pipelines.\nThe Amazon Nova Act SDK also integrates with the new Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser Tool—a fast, secure, cloud-based browser that enables AI agents to interact with websites at scale. It includes enterprise-grade security features, including virtual machine-level isolation and federated identity integration. The tool offers built-in observability through live viewing, AWS CloudTrail logging, and session replay to troubleshoot, maintain quality, and support compliance.\nBenefits of the Amazon Nova Act SDK\nThe Amazon Nova Act SDK is reliable, fast to deploy, and built for secure, large-scale browser automation use cases. In this section, we discuss some of the benefits of the SDK in more detail.\nReliability: Build robust browser automation with high accuracy and repeatability\nWith the Amazon Nova Act SDK, developers can break down complex workflows into reliable atomic commands (for example, collect all form elements of a webpage and return a string with all required fields of the form). It supports the addition of detailed instructions to refine those commands when needed (for example, dismiss any popup banners), the ability to call APIs, and the option to alternate direct browser manipulation through Playwright to improve reliability (for example, for entering passwords). Developers can interleave Python code—such as tests, breakpoints, assertions, or thread pools for parallelization—to optimize performance, especially because even the fastest agents are constrained by webpage load times. With this latest version, the Amazon Nova Act SDK is already demonstrating over 90% reliability across early enterprise workflows, including automated quality assurance, complex form handling, and process execution. Improvements to reasoning and recovery help agents adapt to changing UIs and complete complex sequences consistently and accurately.\nSpeed-to-market: Move from prototype to production in days—not weeks\nThe Amazon Nova Act SDK is designed to help you build automation quickly, without relying on brittle scripts. You can install the SDK with a single command. You can define agents using Python, natural language, or both. You can debug flows while they run, inspect the DOM, pause between steps, and iterate rapidly. The Amazon Nova Act SDK supports the following features:\n\nGit-based CI/CD pipelines\nReusable agent modules\nPlaywright fallbacks for sensitive tasks (for example, password input)\nThreading and parallelization for fast execution\n\nYou don’t have to change your infrastructure or rebuild your internal tools. Agents built with Amazon Nova Act fit into existing dev workflows and allow you to move from experimentation to production quickly.\nSecurity: Deploy automations you can trust—powered by AWS\nThe Amazon Nova Act SDK integrates with IAM for access control, and access to the model is managed just like access from other AWS services. It supports execution on macOS, Linux, Windows, and WSL2. Runtime environments are isolated, and encryption is supported for sensitive inputs and outputs. The Amazon Nova Act SDK was designed to work inside enterprise environments—with the reliability, observability, and security that production systems require.\nSee it in action: Automating information gathering to help streamline financial decisions\nIn financial services—especially investment banking, M&A advisory, and strategic research—success often depends on how fast and accurately teams can turn fragmented public data into actionable insight. The following demo shows the Amazon Nova Act SDK in action.\n\nWhere the Amazon Nova Act SDK can make an impact\nBrowser-based workflows are common in today’s businesses, yet many remain manual, repetitive, and prone to error. The Amazon Nova Act SDK helps organizations automate these tasks, freeing up teams to focus on higher-value work, improve accuracy, and reduce operational delays. Its reliability makes it a fit across industries and use cases. In this section, we provide some examples of what our early customers are building.\nAutomated data entry and form filling\nThe Amazon Nova Act SDK reduces repetitive manual input across web-based systems—like CRMs, HR tools, and finance platforms—by automating form submissions, uploads, and updates. In healthcare, staff assist members with complex, state-specific benefit applications. Public sector caseworkers also re-enter household data across multiple systems. The Amazon Nova Act SDK handles these dynamic flows reliably—navigating shifting fields, dropdowns, and popups without brittle scripts or custom code.\n \nRackspace Technology, a leading hybrid and AI solutions provider, is working with Alvee Health to automatically register members for public benefits using the Amazon Nova Act SDK. “Many registration forms for public programs are long and confusing, so members often don’t apply for the help they need,” said Nicole Cook, CEO at Alvee. “With the Amazon Nova Act SDK and harnessing information already in Alvee’s system, we’re not just simplifying paperwork—we’re helping provide timely, accurate access to the resources that support healthier lives. We expect this innovation to increase successful benefit registrations by 30%, and improve overall case load by up to tenfold, allowing healthcare providers to focus more on patient care and less on administration. This is a prime example of how AI can be used to support well-being and improve overall health for communities.”\nCustomer support augmentation\nCustomer support teams across retail, travel, and software as a service (SaaS) often move between internal tools and third-party portals to resolve tickets. For example, a retail associate might submit a return on a partner site. A travel agent might log in to an airline dashboard to request compensation. A support rep might reset a license key in a customer admin console. The Amazon Nova Act SDK automates these browser-based tasks, helping agents stay focused on customer conversations while backend steps are executed reliably and at speed.\n\nNavan, a leading travel and expense management platform, uses the Amazon Nova Act SDK to simplify its travel agents’ workflows by automating how they fill out payment forms across a wide range of vendors.\nYuval Refua, SVP of Product, said, “Adding the Amazon Nova Act SDK to our agents’ workflows has helped us reduce repetitive tasks—an essential step in scaling our operations to serve more customers. We tried other computer use tools, and Amazon Nova Act’s reliability and flexibility enabled a single script work across diverse payment forms from a range of hotel brands. We’re now expanding this automation to cover even more vendors, which we expect will increase our operational capacity and help us meet growing customer demand more efficiently.”\nAutomating high-stakes administrative workflows\nCredential verification, identity checks, and other compliance-heavy tasks often involve navigating hundreds of third-party portals with inconsistent layouts. The Amazon Nova Act SDK makes it possible to automate these workflows with high accuracy, flexibility, and full control—helping teams scale while maintaining precision.\n\nAutomation Anywhere, a global leader in Agentic Process Automation (APA), is expanding its automation capabilities through the Amazon Nova Act SDK, starting with professional credential verification—a high-stakes, repetitive task that’s essential for compliance, member safety, and day-to-day operations.\n“By deeply integrating the Amazon Nova Act SDK into our Process Reasoning Engine (PRE), we’ve unlocked a major leap forward in computer use for enterprise automation,” said Adi Kuruganti, Chief Product Officer at Automation Anywhere. “Our goal-oriented AI agents don’t just mimic clicks, they reason through UI-based processes in real time, navigating complex websites with human-like expertise. This opens the door to automating previously out-of-reach use cases like healthcare program enrollment testing, where accuracy and scale are essential.”\nUX and QA testing across dynamic interfaces\nUX and QA testing often involves simulating real user interactions on frequently changing websites—especially in sectors like banking, insurance, and government. With the Amazon Nova Act SDK, teams can write and update tests using natural language or Python, adapting quickly to UI changes without brittle selectors or manual rewrites.\n\nTyler Technologies, a leading provider of integrated software and technology services to the public sector, is using the Amazon Nova Act SDK to automate software testing and improve the reliability of its releases. “Amazon Nova Act’s natural-language interface lets us convert our manual test plans into automated suites in minutes—without writing a single line of code, saving us hundreds of hours while expanding test coverage and increasing product quality.” said Franklin Williams, President of Data & Insights at Tyler Technologies. “We’re now looking to expand the use of Nova Act SDK across our portfolio.”\nWhat’s next for the Amazon Nova Act SDK\nWe’re working closely with early AWS customers to inform our roadmap. Although today’s focus is on browser-based workflows, the Amazon Nova Act SDK is part of a broader effort to build agents that can operate reliably across diverse environments. We’re continuing to expand the model’s reach beyond the web, applying reinforcement learning to more complex, real-world tasks. We’re also deepening integration across the AWS ecosystem to help developers move faster—from prototyping to deploying secure, scalable agentic systems.\nGet started with the Amazon Nova Act SDK\nIf you’re a technical leader or developer and want to start prototyping with the research preview of the Amazon Nova Act SDK, visit Amazon Nova Act.

      "description": "This post is co-written with Jessie Jiao from Crypto.com. Crypto.com is a crypto exchange and comprehensive trading service serving 140 million users in 90 countries. To improve the service quality of Crypto.com, the firm implemented generative AI-powered assistant services on AWS.\nModern AI assistants—artificial intelligence systems designed to interact with users through natural language, answer questions, and even perform tasks—face increasingly complex challenges in production environments. Beyond handling basic FAQs, they must now execute meaningful actions, adhere to company policies, implement content filtering, escalate to human operators when needed, and manage follow-up tasks. These requirements demand sophisticated systems capable of handling diverse scenarios while maintaining consistency and compliance.\nTo address these challenges, a modular subsystem architecture proves invaluable. This architectural approach divides an AI system into separate, specialized components that can function independently while working together as a cohesive whole. Such design allows for flexible integration of different processing logics, such as intelligent routing between knowledge bases, dynamic prioritization of information sources, and seamless incorporation of business rules and policies. Each subsystem can be independently developed and optimized for specific tasks while maintaining overall system coherence.\nAs AI assistant systems grow in complexity, with multiple subsystems handling various workloads, prompt engineering emerges as a critical discipline. This art of carefully crafting input text guides language model responses and facilitates consistent behavior across interconnected components. Crafting effective prompts that work across different subsystems while maintaining consistency and accuracy is both critical and time-intensive. This challenge is particularly acute in enterprise environments where precision and reliability are paramount.\nIn this post, we explore how we used user and system feedback to continuously improve and optimize our instruction prompts. This feedback-driven approach has enabled us to create more effective prompts that adapt to various subsystems while maintaining high performance across different use cases.\nFeedback and reasoning: The key to LLM performance improvement\nAlthough large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, they can sometimes struggle with complex or ambiguous inputs. This is where feedback mechanisms become essential. By incorporating feedback loops, LLMs can learn from their mistakes, refine the instruction, and adapt to challenging scenarios.\nOne powerful approach is critiquing, where LLMs are paired with an external feedback mechanism that provide critiques or feedback. For instance, when processing documents, if an LLM generates an incorrect summary, a fact-checking tool can identify inaccuracies and provide feedback. The model can then revise its output, leading to improved accuracy and reliability. This iterative process mirrors human learning, where feedback drives continuous improvement. Consider an example where a customer asks an enterprise AI assistant, “I need to increase my credit limit immediately for an emergency purchase.” The assistant might initially respond with approval steps without verification, but a critique system would flag: “Response bypasses required identity verification protocol and fails to assess qualification criteria per company policy.” With this feedback, the assistant can revise its response to include proper authentication steps, eligibility checking, and alternative options for emergency situations—demonstrating how critiquing facilitates adherence to business rules while maintaining helpful customer service.\nUnlike traditional machine learning (ML) processes where feedback serves as a loss function to update model weights, these feedback mechanisms operate differently in inference-time LLM applications. Rather than modifying the underlying model parameters, feedback provides supplementary instructions that dynamically guide the model’s behavior. This approach allows for behavioral adaptation without the computational expense of retraining, effectively creating a flexible instruction layer that shapes model outputs while preserving the core capabilities of the pre-trained model. Such runtime adaptability represents a significant advancement in making LLMs more responsive to specific requirements without architectural modifications.\nThe effectiveness of feedback mechanisms extends beyond simple error correction, enabling LLMs to develop a nuanced understanding of task requirements. Through iterative feedback cycles, models can learn to interpret ambiguous instructions more effectively, identify implicit context, and adapt their processing strategies accordingly. This capability is particularly valuable in enterprise settings where complex, domain-specific tasks require precise interpretation of instructions. By analyzing feedback patterns over time, LLMs can even anticipate potential misunderstandings and proactively adjust their approach, leading to more efficient and accurate outcomes. In our research implementing this approach for financial services classification tasks, we observed substantial performance improvements—from initial accuracy rates of 60% to eventually achieving 100% through systematic feedback incorporation. Each iteration addressed specific weaknesses identified in previous rounds, demonstrating how structured critique leads to continuous model improvement.\nFor deeper insights into these mechanisms, we recommend exploring two key research papers: CRITIC: Large Language Models Can Self-Correct with Tool-Interactive Critiquing, which demonstrates how LLMs can self-correct with tool-interactive critiquing, and Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning, which explores language agents with verbal reinforcement learning. The following figure provides a visual representation of this feedback process.\n\nRecent developments in reasoning capabilities have made this feedback process even more powerful. Modern LLMs can now engage in sophisticated analysis of their own outputs, breaking down complex problems into manageable components and systematically evaluating each aspect of their performance. To learn more, see Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet hybrid reasoning model is now available in Amazon Bedrock and DeepSeek-R1 now available as a fully managed serverless model in Amazon Bedrock. This self-analysis capability, combined with external feedback, creates a robust framework for continuous improvement.\nConsider a scenario where an LLM is tasked with sentiment analysis. Initially, when classifying a mixed review like “The product worked as advertised, but customer service was disappointing,” the model might incorrectly label it as positive. Through error analysis and verification, a critique mechanism (powered by a separate reasoning model) can provide targeted feedback, explaining that negative statements about service quality significantly impact overall sentiment. This feedback doesn’t modify the model’s weights but instead serves as supplementary instruction that enriches the original prompt template, helping the model properly weigh contrasting sentiments within the same text.\nOver multiple feedback iterations, the LLM employs reasoning capabilities to incorporate this external feedback and develop more sophisticated classification heuristics. With the critique system continuously verifying outputs and providing constructive guidance, the model learns to identify why certain patterns lead to misclassifications and refines its approach accordingly. When encountering new ambiguous reviews, it can now apply these learned insights to correctly interpret subtle emotional nuances. This demonstrates how reasoning-based feedback effectively modifies the instruction context without requiring parameter adjustments, allowing for continuous improvement through analytical understanding rather than mechanical optimization.\nIn the next section, we explore how these feedback mechanisms and reasoning capability can be operationalized to enhance workflows.\nSolution overview\nThe integration of feedback and reasoning creates a powerful learning loop: feedback identifies areas for improvement, reasoning capabilities analyze the root causes of issues, and the resulting insights drive specific, actionable changes. This systematic approach to improvement makes sure that each iteration brings the model closer to optimal performance, while maintaining transparency and accountability in the development process.\n\nFor practical examples and complete implementation code of this process, check out our GitHub repository. This repository includes sample datasets, evaluation frameworks, and ready-to-use templates for each step of the optimization workflow.\nOur proposed solution uses two foundation models (FMs) through Amazon Bedrock: Amazon Nova for executing instructional tasks and optimizing the instruction prompt, and Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 or DeepSeek-R1 for error analysis and feedback generation. Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed service, provides access to high-performance FMs from leading AI companies, enabling flexible model selection and testing. You can explore illustration_notebook_optimization_prompt.ipynb for a quick walkthrough of the high-level process for LLM optimization, which demonstrates key concepts and implementation details in an accessible format.\nLLM optimization workflow\nThe following is the high-level process for LLM optimization:\n\nThe process begins with a precise articulation of task requirements and success criteria. This crucial first step involves three key components: defining specific task objectives, crafting a well-structured prompt template with clear instructions, and assembling a comprehensive evaluation dataset with verified ground truth labels. During this phase, we establish quantifiable success metrics and acceptance criteria to measure improvement effectively. The Amazon Nova Pro understanding model is configured to provide both task outputs and detailed explanations for its decisions, enabling transparency in the evaluation process.\n\nFor illustration, we started with a simple prompt template to categorize customer inquiries into multiple classes, such as PASSWORD_RESET, ESCALATION, and OUT_OF_SCOPE. This initial template provided only basic category definitions without detailed guidance on edge cases or classification priorities, serving as our baseline for improvement. You can refer to the test case dataset and initial template.\n\nFollowing the setup, we conduct rigorous testing against ground truth data to evaluate model performance. This evaluation focuses on both successful and failed cases, with particular emphasis on analyzing misclassifications. The model’s generated explanations for each decision serve as valuable insights into its reasoning process. We collect both quantitative performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) and qualitative insights into error patterns, creating a comprehensive performance baseline.\n\nDuring this step, we compare model predictions to ground truth labels and record both quantitative metrics and detailed error cases. For example, when a customer urgently reports unauthorized account changes with “Someone must have accessed my account…I need this fixed immediately”, the model might incorrectly classify it as CARD_DISPUTE instead of the correct ESCALATION category. Each prediction is logged with its success status (true/false), the model’s explanation, and the correct label. This comprehensive analysis creates a structured dataset of both successful classifications and failure cases, providing critical input for the reasoning-based optimization in the next step.\n\nThe key step of our optimization process lies in systematic error analysis using a dedicated reasoning framework. This framework examines the model’s explanations for each error case, identifying root causes and pattern recognition failures. Beyond individual error analysis, we employ pattern recognition to identify systemic issues across multiple cases. The reasoning model, in our case Anthropic’s Claude 3.7, incorporates historical feedback and learning patterns to generate specific, actionable feedback for prompt improvement. This critical step produces structured, detailed recommendations for prompt optimization.\n\nThe reasoning model analyzed classification performance through a structured framework that identified error patterns, investigated prompt-specific root causes, considered historical context from previous iterations, and suggested targeted improvements. This methodical approach focused exclusively on enhancing prompt clarity, structure, and precision—avoiding model or data modifications outside the scope of prompt engineering. By systematically addressing ambiguities and refining classification criteria, we achieved progressively better performance with each iteration. See the following code:\n\ncritique_prompt_template = \"\"\"\n    Analyze classification performance and provide reasoning for prompt improvements:\n    Current Template: ${input_current_template}\n    Evaluation Results: ${evaluation_results}\n    \n    Follow these thinking steps:\n    1. Error Pattern Analysis:\n    2. Root Cause Investigation:\n    3. Historical Context Review:\n       • Previous suggestions: ${suggestion_history}\n    4. Prompt Improvement Ideas:\n     \n    Output final suggestions between <suggestion> </suggestion> tags\n\"\"\"\n\nYou can see the detailed implementation in error_analysis_with_reasoning.py.\n\nUsing the structured feedback from the reasoning framework, we implement targeted modifications to the prompt template. These refinements might include enhancing instruction clarity, adjusting classification parameters, or restructuring the prompt format. Each modification directly addresses specific issues identified in the analysis phase, making sure changes are evidence-based and purposeful. The focus remains on improving the instruction layer rather than modifying the underlying model architecture.\n\nTo implement these structured improvements, we developed a systematic prompt rewriting mechanism encoded in our prompt_rewrite.py module. This component transforms analytical feedback into concrete prompt enhancements through a dedicated template-based approach. The rewriting process follows a methodical workflow: it preserves essential components like placeholders, incorporates specific improvements identified in the analysis, and makes sure modifications directly address root causes from the feedback. This systematic rewriting approach guarantees that each iteration builds upon previous learnings rather than making arbitrary changes.\n\nrewrite_prompt_template = \"\"\"\nTASK: Improve the prompt template based on critique feedback.\nINPUT:\n- Current Template: ${input_current_template}\n- Critique Analysis: ${critique_feedbacks}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Preserve the current template structure and all placeholders\n2. Implement specific improvements identified in the critique\n3. Focus on addressing root causes of errors\n4. Create a complete, ready-to-use improved template\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n- Root cause summary\n- Improved template incorporating all recommended changes\nThe improved template should directly address identified issues while remaining concise and effective.\n\"\"\"\n\n\nThe optimization process concludes each iteration by testing the refined prompt against the evaluation dataset. We measure performance improvements through comparative analysis of key metrics and conduct quality assessments of new outputs. This phase initiates the next iteration cycle, where successful changes are incorporated into the baseline, and newly identified challenges inform the next round of optimization. This creates a sustainable improvement loop that progressively enhances prompt effectiveness while maintaining detailed documentation of successful strategies.\n\nThrough our iterative refinement process, we transformed a basic prompt into a highly effective instruction set for LLMs. Each iteration strategically addressed specific weaknesses identified through our structured analysis framework. For complete documentation of each iteration’s analysis and improvements, see iteration_log.\nWhat began as a simple prompt evolved into a comprehensive set of instructions incorporating nuanced task boundaries, explicit priority rules for edge cases, hierarchical decision criteria, and precise handling instructions for corner cases. Rather than modify model weights or architecture, our approach used targeted feedback from a critique mechanism to enhance the instruction layer, effectively guiding model behavior without retraining. Each iteration built upon lessons from previous rounds, systematically addressing error patterns revealed through our critique framework. The feedback served as supplementary instructions that enriched the original prompt template, allowing the model to develop increasingly sophisticated processing heuristics over time.\nResults\nThrough these iterative approaches, we benchmarked the solution on the production system. Our comparative analysis between the initial and final prompts revealed several important patterns:\n\nBoundary confusion was resolved by adding explicit prioritization rules between overlapping categories\nEdge case handling improved by incorporating specific examples that defined thresholds for categorization\nDecision transparency increased through structured reasoning requirements in the output format\nClassification consistency was enhanced by adding counterexamples to help prevent overcategorization in sensitive areas\n\nThrough 10 deliberate iterations and the incorporation of detailed task-specific instructions, we achieved a remarkable 34-percentage-point improvement in task effectiveness, transforming a basic prompt with 60% accuracy into a robust classification system with 94% accuracy on challenging cases. This validates not only our iterative optimization strategy but demonstrates how systematic prompt refinement can dramatically enhance LLM model performance without modifying the underlying model architecture.\nConclusion\nThe integration of feedback mechanisms into AI assistant systems represents a significant leap forward in conversational AI capabilities. By implementing robust feedback loops, we’ve demonstrated how AI assistants can evolve from static question-answering systems to dynamic, self-improving resources. The modular subsystem architecture, combined with continuous prompt optimization through feedback, enables AI assistants to handle increasingly complex tasks while maintaining compliance and accuracy.\nAs we’ve shown through practical examples and research insights, feedback-driven systems not only produce better outputs but also allow for more effective and streamlined input instructions over time. This efficiency gain is particularly valuable in enterprise environments where precision and adaptability are crucial, and where model retraining is costly or impractical. Each iteration builds upon lessons from previous rounds, systematically addressing error patterns revealed through our critique framework.\nLooking ahead, the continued refinement of feedback mechanisms and prompt engineering techniques will be essential for developing next-generation AI assistant systems. By embracing these approaches, organizations can create AI assistants that not only meet current demands but also adapt to future challenges, delivering increasingly sophisticated and reliable interactions. We invite you to try our proposed feedback-driven prompt optimization approach in your own applications. For those interested in implementing these techniques, Amazon Bedrock provides an ideal landscape for exploring these methods in your specific business contexts, offering a selection of FMs with flexible deployment options.\n\nAbout the authors\nJessie Jiao is a Senior Software Engineer at crypto.com, where she leverages her extensive experience in designing, building, and implementing enterprise applications with LLM models and AI technologies.

      "description": "Building modern serverless applications on AWS requires navigating best practices to manage the integration between multiple services, such as AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon EventBridge. Security considerations, performance optimization, and implementing a comprehensive monitoring systems adds further requirements to build a serverless architecture while adhering to AWS best practices.\nAmazon Q Developer CLI with Model Context Protocol (MCP) supports getting started with serverless applications using natural language conversations that produce infrastructure configurations and architectural guidance aligned with AWS best practices. This reduces the need to manually research documentation or piece together solutions from disparate sources.\nThis post explores how the AWS Serverless MCP server accelerates development throughout the serverless lifecycle, from making architectural decisions with tools like get_iac_guidance and get_lambda_guidance, to streamlining development with get_serverless_templates, sam_init, to deployment with SAM integration, webapp_deployment_help, and configure_domain. We show how this conversational AI approach transforms the entire process, from architecture design through operations, dramatically accelerating AWS serverless projects while adhering to architectural principles.\nSolution overview\nAmazon Q Developer CLI serves as a powerful terminal-based gateway to the AI capabilities of Amazon Q, bringing conversational intelligence directly to your command line environment. Although you can also apply this approach to conversational AI in the interactive development environment’s (IDE’s) agentic chat, this innovative interface transforms how developers work by enabling natural language interactions with AWS services and development tools without leaving the terminal. By typing queries or requests in plain English, developers can harness the full potential of generative AI with Amazon Q to solve complex problems, generate code snippets, troubleshoot issues, and access AWS best practices—all from the familiar comfort of their preferred terminal application.\nHowever, although Amazon Q CLI provides the conversational interface, it needs a way to connect with external tools and data sources. This is where MCP comes in.\nMCP is a groundbreaking open standard created by Anthropic that bridges the gap between AI models and external data sources or tools. This protocol establishes a unified framework allowing large language models (LLMs) to seamlessly interact with diverse information systems and specialized capabilities. When applied to serverless development workflows, this capability transforms how developers build AWS applications.\nMCP transforms Amazon Q CLI for serverless development by bridging the gap between traditional approaches and modern AI-assisted workflows. This integration replaces manual documentation research and trial-and-error development with conversational access to AWS expertise, automated code generation, and intelligent configuration assistance—directly from the command line.\nNow that we have discussed the conceptual benefits of Amazon Q CLI and MCP, let’s explore how to set up these tools in your development environment.\nPrerequisites\nYou must have the following prerequisites:\n\nAn AWS account with credentials configured\nThe AWS Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (AWS SAM CLI) installed\nThe AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) installed\n\nPrepare your environment\nBefore you can start constructing this serverless solution, you must configure your IDE by installing and setting up Amazon Q CLI and the AWS Serverless MCP server. This section provides comprehensive guidance for properly installing and configuring the required components.\nInstall Amazon Q Developer CLI You can install Amazon Q Developer CLI independently on your system. To get started, complete the following steps:\n\nConfirm successful installation with this terminal command:\n\n\nq --version \n\nThe system should now show something similar to the following output:\n\nq 1.x.x\n\n\nLog in to your AWS account:\n\n\nq login\n\n\nSelect your preferred authentication option: \n  \nUse for free with Builder ID\nPro license\n \n\nSet up MCP servers\nBefore you can start using MCP servers with Amazon Q CLI, you must install several prerequisites and configure your environment. Complete the following steps:\nInstall uv with the following command:\n\npip install uv\n\nInstall Python 3.10 or newer using the following command:\n\nuv python install 3.10\n\nAdd the following code to your MCP client global configuration (~/.aws/amazonq/mcp.json file). This can be configured by project (.amazonq/mcp.json) in the current folder. The AWS Serverless MCP server uses the default AWS profile by default. Specify a value in AWS_PROFILE if you want to use a different profile. Similarly, adjust the AWS Region and log-level values as needed:\n\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"awslabs.aws-serverless-mcp\": {\n            \"command\": \"uvx\",\n            \"args\": [\n                \"awslabs.aws-serverless-mcp-server\"\n            ],\n            \"env\": {\n                \"AWS_PROFILE\": \"your-aws-profile\",\n                \"AWS_REGION\": \"us-east-1\",\n                \"FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL\": \"ERROR\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nAmazon Q CLI seamlessly detects and integrates with MCP servers configured in the ~/.aws/amazonq/mcp.json file.\nThe MCP servers support several configuration options to customize your development experience:\n\nAuto-approve – Configure which tools can be used without prompting for approval\nEnvironment variables – Customize server behavior through environment variables\nDisabled flag – Temporarily disable specific servers when not needed\n\nThe following is an example of how to configure your AWS Serverless MCP server using the preceding options:\n\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"awslabs.aws-serverless-mcp\": {\n            \"command\": \"uvx\",\n            \"args\": [\n                \"awslabs.aws-serverless-mcp-server\"\n            ],\n            \"env\": {\n                \"AWS_PROFILE\": \"your-aws-profile\",\n                \"AWS_REGION\": \"us-east-1\",\n                \"FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL\": \"ERROR\"\n            },\n            \"disabled\": false,\n            \"autoApprove\": [\n                \"search_documentation\",\n                \"read_documentation\",\n                \"recommend\"\n            ],\n            \"trusted\": [\n                \"search_documentation\",\n                \"read_documentation\",\n                \"recommend\"\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\nTest your setup\nTo verify that everything is working correctly, generate a simple serverless function. Start the Amazon Q CLI chat interface and verify the output shows MCP servers being loaded and initialized:\n\nq chat\n\n\nThe message in the preceding screenshot might not match what you see for your use case, especially when your MCP servers take longer to load.\nNow that you’ve confirmed your environment is properly configured, you can begin exploring the serverless development workflow. The first step in this journey is making informed architectural decisions that will shape your application.\nArchitecture and design phase\nThe architecture and design phase is where your serverless application takes shape. Making the right decisions at this stage can significantly impact your project’s success, scalability, and maintainability. The AWS Serverless MCP server provides powerful tools to guide these critical early decisions.\nWhen starting a new serverless project, choosing the right infrastructure as code (IaC) approach is crucial for long-term success. The AWS Serverless MCP server’s get_iac_guidance_tool transforms this decision-making process from hours of research into a simple conversation. This powerful tool provides comprehensive, contextual guidance tailored to your specific needs by analyzing factors such as:\n\nProject complexity and scale\nTeam expertise and preferences\nRequired deployment flexibility\nLocal testing requirements\nLong-term maintenance considerations\n\nLet’s see how this works in practice by asking Amazon Q about the best IaC approach for your serverless application:\nWhat's the best IaC approach for my serverless application?\nBecause Amazon Q is using get_iac_guidance for the first time, it will ask you to enter t to trust this tool for the entire session, y to allow the execution of this tool only one time, or n to reject the execution of this tool.\nThe following example is for an ecommerce application. \nAfter approving the tool usage, you will receive a comprehensive, contextual response tailored to your specific architecture needs. For example:\n\n\nAWS SAM for Your E-Commerce Microservices\n\nBased on your e-commerce microservices architecture, I recommend AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) as your primary IaC tool for the serverless components of your application. \n\nHere is why it is particularly well-suited for your needs:\n\n1. Perfect for Your Serverless Components: SAM is specifically designed for the serverless parts of your architecture like the Payment Service (Lambda) and notification systems.\n\n2. Simplified Syntax: SAM provides a simplified way to define Lambda functions, API Gateway, and DynamoDB tables - all key components in your architecture.\n\n3. Local Testing: You can test your Lambda functions locally before deployment, which is crucial for your payment processing service.\n\n4. Integration with Your Architecture: SAM works seamlessly with the API Gateway and Lambda components shown in your diagram.\n\n5. Deployment Independence: Supports your microservices approach where \"each microservice can be deployed independently\" as mentioned in your documentation.\n\nExample SAM Template for Your Payment Service:\n\nAWSTemplateFormatVersion: \"2010-09-09\"\nTransform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31\n\nResources:\n  PaymentFunction:\n    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function\n    Properties:\n      CodeUri: ./payment-service/\n      Handler: index.handler\n      Runtime: nodejs22.x\n      Policies:\n        - SQSPollerPolicy:\n            QueueName: !GetAtt PaymentQueue.QueueName\n      Events:\n        SQSEvent:\n          Type: SQS\n          Properties:\n            Queue: !GetAtt PaymentQueue.Arn\n            BatchSize: 10\n\n  PaymentQueue:\n    Type: AWS::SQS::Queue\n    Properties:\n      VisibilityTimeout: 300\n\nDevelopment acceleration phase\nAfter you’ve made key architectural decisions, you enter the development phase. This is often the most time-consuming part of the process, requiring significant effort to implement patterns correctly, handle edge cases, and follow best practices. The AWS Serverless MCP server provides tools that dramatically accelerate this phase by using proven patterns and templates.\nThe get_serverless_template tool alleviates the need to start from scratch by providing access to production-ready serverless patterns from the AWS Serverless Land GitHub repository. These patterns are tested, follow AWS best practices, and can be customized to meet your specific requirements.\nLet’s say you want to understand more about serverless architecture. With this tool, you can discover and implement common serverless architectures with a simple conversation. For example, you can ask Amazon Q the following question:\nShow me Node.js API templates for serverless applications\nBecause Amazon Q is using get_serverless_templates for the first time, it will ask you to enter t to trust this tool for the session, y to trust the tool only for this time, or n to reject the use of this tool. \nYou will have to trust at least this tool if not more. After trusting the tool, you should get a response similar to the following:\n\nHere are some Node.js API templates for serverless applications on AWS:\n\n1. API Gateway to SQS Integration\n\nThis template creates a REST API Gateway that directly integrates with AWS SQS to read messages:\n\nKey Features:\n- Direct service integration between API Gateway and SQS\n- No Lambda function required\n- Support for query string parameters\n- Ideal for retrieving messages via HTTPS without AWS SDK\n\nUse Cases:\n- Web applications polling SQS queues\n- Mobile apps requiring secure access to SQS\n- Third-party integrations\n\nGitHub Link: https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns/tree/main/APIGateway-SQS-ReceiveMessages\n\n2. Application Load Balancer with Lambda REST API\n\nWhile this example uses Python, the pattern is applicable to Node.js as well:\n\nKey Features:\n- Path-based listener rules on ALB\n- Lambda function as the target\n- RESTful API implementation\n\nGitHub Link: https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns/tree/main/alb-lambda-rest-api-sam-py\n\n3. Full-Stack Integration: Amplify + Cognito + API Gateway + Lambda\n\nThis template demonstrates a complete serverless stack with authentication:\n\nKey Features:\n- AWS Amplify frontend\n- Cognito for authentication\n- API Gateway with Cognito authorizer\n- Lambda backend\n- Environment variables shared between frontend and backend\n\nGitHub Link: https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns/tree/main/amplify_cognito_apigateway_lambda_envvariables\n\nDevelopment and testing phase\nThe development and testing phase is where your serverless application takes shape through code. This phase requires tools that streamline the creation, building, and testing of your application components. The AWS Serverless MCP server provides a suite of tools that integrate seamlessly with the AWS SAM CLI, enabling a smooth development experience from project initialization to local testing.\nBeginning a new serverless project with the right structure and configuration can be challenging. The sam_init tool reduces this hurdle by creating well-structured projects that follow AWS best practices out of the box. This tool provides templates for various serverless application types, helping you start with a solid foundation.\nFor example, you can ask the following question:\nCreate a new SAM project for a Python REST API\nBecause Amazon Q is using sam_init for the first time, it will ask you to enter t to trust this tool for the session, y to trust the tool only for this time, or n to reject the use of this tool. \nThe sam_init tool is used to initialize a new serverless application using AWS SAM. It creates a complete project structure with the necessary files to develop, test, and deploy serverless applications on AWS.\nThe tool has the following key capabilities:\n\nIt creates a new project directory with a standardized structure for serverless applications\nIt generates an AWS SAM template file (template.yaml) that defines your infrastructure as code\nIt sets up the initial code for Lambda functions in your chosen runtime (Python, Node.js, and so on)\nIt configures the project with the appropriate dependency management system\n\nFor your ecommerce microservices architecture, this tool would be particularly useful for:\n\nCreating individual microservices (like your product catalog service or payment service)\nSetting up serverless API endpoints through API Gateway\nEstablishing the foundation for event-driven communication between services\n\nThe tool supports various application templates and runtimes, helping you quickly bootstrap different types of serverless applications, from simple APIs to more complex event-processing systems.\nDeployment and configuration phase\nAfter you have developed and tested your serverless application locally, the next step is deploying it to the AWS Cloud. This phase often involves complex, multi-step processes to make sure the components are properly deployed, configured, and integrated. The AWS Serverless MCP server provides specialized tools that simplify these processes, enabling smooth deployments with minimal manual intervention.\nStreamline full-stack deployments\nFor this use case, we’re building a full-stack serverless application with a React frontend, Node.js backend APIs, and DynamoDB database. Traditionally, this would require manually configuring multiple AWS services, managing deployment pipelines, and validating proper integration between components.\nThe webapp_deployment_help tool transforms this complex process into a single, streamlined operation that handles the different aspects of deployment while following AWS best practices.\nYou can ask Amazon Q the following question:\nDeploy my React application to AWS with serverless backend\nBecause Amazon Q is using webapp_deployment_help for the first time, it will ask you to enter t to trust this tool for the session, y to trust the tool only for this time, or n to reject the use of this tool. For this example, trust this tool for the session. \nThis tool supports three deployment types:\n\nBackend only – Deploys a backend application to Lambda with API Gateway\nFrontend only – Deploys a frontend application to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon CloudFront\nFull stack – Deploys both backend and frontend components together\n\nIt uses AWS Lambda Web Adapter, so you can deploy standard web applications (like Express.js, Flask, and React) to Lambda without needing to modify your code to follow Lambda-specific conventions.\nFor your ecommerce microservices architecture, this tool is particularly useful because it aligns with several components in your diagram:\n\nIt can deploy your frontend to CloudFront\nIt can deploy your microservices as Lambda functions or containers\nIt integrates with API Gateway for API management\n\nThe tool requires you to build your application first using your framework’s build command (like npm run build for React), then it handles the deployment to AWS, including setting up the necessary infrastructure.\nSet up custom domains\nAlthough your application is now deployed and accessible using AWS generated URLs, professional applications typically require branded, custom domain names for a better user experience. However, configuring custom domains traditionally involves multiple complex steps across several AWS services. The configure_domain tool simplifies this process into a single, intuitive conversation.\nYou can ask Amazon Q the following question:\nConfigure my custom domain example.com for my serverless application\nBecause Amazon Q is using configure_domain for the first time, it will ask you to enter t to trust this tool for the session, y to trust the tool only for this time, or n to reject the use of this tool. \nGet the steps to configure your domain as follows:\n\nSteps to Configure a Custom Domain for Your Serverless Application\n\n1. Prerequisites \n- Ensure you own the domain name (example.com) \n- Have a Route 53 hosted zone for your domain \n- Have deployed your serverless application (e.g., your e-commerce-app)\n\n2. Create an SSL Certificate with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)\n- bash\n# Request a certificate for your domain. Region must be us-east-1 for CloudFront distributions\n- aws acm request-certificate --domain-name example.com --validation-method DNS --region us-east-1\n# Note the certificate ARN from the output\n\n3. Validate the Certificate \n- Go to the ACM console \n- Find your certificate and click on it \n- Create the DNS validation records in Route 53 \n- Wait for validation to complete (can take up to 30 minutes)\n\nThe tool orchestrates a comprehensive domain setup process that includes the following steps:\n\nCreating and validating AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificates for secure HTTPS connections\nConfiguring Amazon Route 53 DNS records to point to your application\nSetting up API Gateway custom domain mappings\nAssociating CloudFront distributions with your domain\nEstablishing proper cache behaviors and security settings\n\nThis automation alleviates the need to navigate between multiple AWS console pages and services, reducing the risk of configuration errors while making sure your domain setup follows security best practices. The tool also handles the complexities of certificate validation and DNS propagation, providing clear guidance throughout the process.\nWith configure_domain, you can transform your application’s user experience from generic AWS endpoints to professional, branded domains in minutes rather than hours.\nHaving walked through the complete serverless development lifecycle—from architecture decisions to deployment and configuration—we can now appreciate the transformative impact of Amazon Q CLI with MCP on the entire process.\nNext steps\nTo continue your serverless journey with Amazon Q CLI and MCP, we recommend a progressive approach to building your expertise:\n\nBegin with a simple project like a basic Lambda function triggered by an API Gateway endpoint or Amazon S3 event to familiarize yourself with the conversational development workflow and gain confidence in the generated solutions.\nExplore different serverless patterns by experimenting with event-driven architectures using EventBridge for decoupled communication, orchestration workflows with AWS Step Functions, or building comprehensive API-backed applications with API Gateway and Lambda.\\\nAs your applications mature, integrate the generated code into your continuous integration and deployment pipelines using services like AWS CodePipeline or AWS CodeBuild to automate testing and deployment processes.\nEnhance your applications with robust observability by implementing monitoring, logging, and tracing using Amazon CloudWatch, AWS X-Ray, and Powertools for AWS Lambda (Python) to gain insights into performance and troubleshoot issues effectively.\nShare your experiences and suggestions with the community to contribute to the improvement of MCP servers and help shape the future of AI-assisted serverless development.\n\nConclusion\nBy using Amazon Q CLI with MCP servers, you can accelerate your serverless application development while adhering to AWS best practices. This approach helps you focus on your business logic while Amazon Q handles the implementation details, resulting in more robust, scalable, and secure applications.\nThe ability to generate code, configurations, and architecture recommendations in minutes rather than hours creates a comprehensive development experience that makes sure the different components adhere to best practices while providing actionable, specific implementation guidance. The iterative nature of this approach helps teams quickly compare different architectural decisions through simple prompts, while continuously validating their implementations against official AWS documentation.\nHaving explored the capabilities and benefits of this approach, you’re now ready to apply these concepts in your own projects.\nAs you continue exploring serverless application development with Amazon Q CLI and MCP, we encourage you to deepen your knowledge with the following resources:\n\nThe MCP documentation provides valuable insights into how MCP enhances the capabilities of Amazon Q beyond basic interactions.\nThe AWS SAM documentation offers comprehensive guidance for serverless application development patterns and deployment strategies.\nTo learn more about Amazon Q CLI, refer to Using Amazon Q Developer on the command line.\nWhen focusing on architectural excellence, the AWS Well-Architected Framework provides foundational principles for implementing security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization, and operational excellence.\nFor serverless-specific architectural guidance that addresses the unique characteristics of this computing model, refer to the specialized Serverless Lens for Well-Architected Framework tailored specifically for serverless applications.\nTo enhance your development workflow, Powertools for AWS Lambda (Python) offers ready-to-use utilities for structured logging, metrics collection, and distributed tracing.

      "description": "Legal teams spend bulk of their time manually reviewing documents during eDiscovery. This process involves analyzing electronically stored information across emails, contracts, financial records, and collaboration systems for legal proceedings. This manual approach creates significant bottlenecks: attorneys must identify privileged communications, assess legal risks, extract contractual obligations, and maintain regulatory compliance across thousands of documents per case. The process is not only resource-intensive and time-consuming, but also prone to human error when dealing with large document volumes.\nAmazon Bedrock Agents with multi-agent collaboration directly addresses these challenges by helping organizations deploy specialized AI agents that process documents in parallel while maintaining context across complex legal workflows. Instead of sequential manual review, multiple agents work simultaneously—one extracts contract terms while another identifies privileged communications, all coordinated by a central orchestrator. This approach can reduce document review time by 60–70% while maintaining the accuracy and human oversight required for legal proceedings, though actual performance varies based on document complexity and foundation model (FM) selection.\nIn this post, we demonstrate how to build an intelligent eDiscovery solution using Amazon Bedrock Agents for real-time document analysis. We show how to deploy specialized agents for document classification, contract analysis, email review, and legal document processing, all working together through a multi-agent architecture. We walk through the implementation details, deployment steps, and best practices to create an extensible foundation that organizations can adapt to their specific eDiscovery requirements.\nSolution overview\nThis solution demonstrates an intelligent document analysis system using Amazon Bedrock Agents with multi-agent collaboration functionality. The system uses multiple specialized agents to analyze legal documents, classify content, assess risks, and provide structured insights. The following diagram illustrates the solution architecture.\n\nThe architecture diagram shows three main workflows for eDiscovery document analysis:\n\nReal-time document analysis workflow – Attorneys and clients (authenticated users) can upload documents and interact through mobile/web clients and chat. Documents are processed in real time for immediate analysis without persistent storage—uploaded documents are passed directly to the Amazon Bedrock Collaborator Agent endpoint.\nCase research document analysis workflow – This workflow is specifically for attorneys (authenticated users). It allows document review and analysis through mobile/web clients and chat. It’s focused on the legal research aspects of previously processed documents.\nDocument upload workflow – Law firm clients (authenticated users) can upload documents through mobile/web clients. Documents are transferred by using AWS Transfer Family web apps to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket for storage.\n\nAlthough this architecture supports all three workflows, this post focuses specifically on implementing the real-time document analysis workflow for two key reasons: it represents the core functionality that delivers immediate value to legal teams, and it provides the foundational patterns that can be extended to support the other workflows. The real-time processing capability demonstrates the multi-agent coordination that makes this solution transformative for eDiscovery operations.\nReal-time document analysis workflow\nThis workflow processes uploaded documents through coordinated AI agents, typically completing analysis within 1–2 minutes of upload. The system accelerates early case assessment by providing structured insights immediately, compared to traditional manual review that can take hours per document. The implementation coordinates five specialized agents that process different document aspects in parallel, listed in the following table.\n\n\n\nAgent Type\nPrimary Function\nProcessing Time*\nKey Outputs\n\n\n\n\nCollaborator Agent\nCentral orchestrator and workflow manager\n2–5 seconds\nDocument routing decisions, consolidated results\n\n\nDocument Classification Agent\nInitial document triage and sensitivity detection\n5–10 seconds\nDocument type, confidence scores, sensitivity flags\n\n\nEmail Analysis Agent\nCommunication pattern analysis\n10–20 seconds\nParticipant maps, conversation threads, timelines\n\n\nLegal Document Analysis Agent\nCourt filing and legal brief analysis\n15–30 seconds\nCase citations, legal arguments, procedural dates\n\n\nContract Analysis Agent\nContract terms and risk assessment\n20–40 seconds\nParty details, key terms, obligations, risk scores\n\n\n\n*Processing times are estimates based on testing with Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Haiku on Amazon Bedrock and might vary depending on document complexity and size. Actual performance in your environment may differ.\nLet’s explore an example of processing a sample legal settlement agreement. The workflow consists of the following steps:\n\nThe Collaborator Agent identifies the document as requiring both contract and legal analysis.\nThe Contract Analysis Agent extracts parties, payment terms, and obligations (40 seconds).\nThe Legal Document Analysis Agent identifies case references and precedents (30 seconds).\nThe Document Classification Agent flags confidentiality levels (10 seconds).\nThe Collaborator Agent consolidates findings into a comprehensive report (15 seconds).\n\nTotal processing time is approximately 95 seconds for the sample document, compared to 2–4 hours of manual review for similar documents. In the following sections, we walk through deploying the complete eDiscovery solution, including Amazon Bedrock Agents, the Streamlit frontend, and necessary AWS resources.\nPrerequisites\nMake sure you have the following prerequisites:\n\nAn AWS account with appropriate permissions for Amazon Bedrock, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), and AWS CloudFormation.\nAmazon Bedrock model access for Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Haiku v1 in your deployment AWS Region. You can use a different supported model of your choice for this solution. If you use a different model than the default (Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Haiku v1), you must modify the CloudFormation template to reflect your chosen model’s specifications before deployment. At the time of writing, Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Haiku is available in US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), and US West (Oregon). For current model availability, see Model support by AWS Region.\nThe AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) installed and configured with appropriate credentials.\nPython 3.8+ installed.\nTerminal or command prompt access.\n\nDeploy the AWS infrastructure\nYou can deploy the following CloudFormation template, which creates the five Amazon Bedrock agents, inference profile, and supporting IAM resources. (Costs will be incurred for the AWS resources used). Complete the following steps:\n\nLaunch the CloudFormation stack.\n\nYou will be redirected to the AWS CloudFormation console. In the stack parameters, the template URL will be prepopulated.\n\nFor EnvironmentName, enter a name for your deployment (default: LegalBlogSetup).\nReview and create the stack.\n\nAfter successful deployment, note the following values from the CloudFormation stack’s Outputs tab:\n\nCollabBedrockAgentId\nCollabBedrockAgentAliasId\n\n\nConfigure AWS credentials\nTest if AWS credentials are working:aws sts get-caller-identityIf you need to configure credentials, use the following command:\n\naws configure\n\nSet up the local environment\nComplete the following steps to set up your local environment:\n\nCreate a new directory for your project:\n\n\nmkdir bedrock-document-analyzer\ncd bedrock-document-analyzer\n\n\nSet up a Python virtual environment:\n\n\n#On macOS/Linux:\nsource venv/bin/activate \n#On Windows:\nvenv\\Scripts\\activate\n\n\nDownload the Streamlit application:\n\n\ncurl -O https://aws-blogs-artifacts-public.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ML-18253/eDiscovery-LegalBlog-UI.py\n\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n\npip install streamlit boto3 PyPDF2 python-docx\n\nConfigure and run the application\nComplete the following steps:\n\nRun the downloaded Streamlit frontend UI file eDiscovery-LegalBlog-UI.py by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n\n\nstreamlit run eDiscovery-LegalBlog-UI.py\n\nThis command will start the Streamlit server and automatically open the application in your default web browser.\n\nUnder Agent configuration, provide the following values: \n  \nFor AWS_REGION, enter your Region.\nFor AGENT_ID, enter the Amazon Bedrock Collaborator Agent ID.\nFor AGENT_ALIAS_ID, enter the Amazon Bedrock Collaborator Agent Alias ID.\n \nChoose Save Configuration.\n\n\nNow you can upload documents (TXT, PDF, and DOCX) to analyze and interact with.\nTest the solution\nThe following is a demonstration of testing the application.\n\nImplementation considerations\nAlthough Amazon Bedrock Agents significantly streamlines eDiscovery workflows, organizations should consider several key factors when implementing AI-powered document analysis solutions. Consider the following legal industry requirements for compliance and governance:\n\nAttorney-client privilege protection – AI systems must maintain confidentiality boundaries and can’t expose privileged communications during processing\nCross-jurisdictional compliance – GDPR, CCPA, and industry-specific regulations vary by region and case type\nAudit trail requirements – Legal proceedings demand comprehensive processing documentation for all AI-assisted decisions\nProfessional responsibility – Lawyers remain accountable for AI outputs and must demonstrate competency in deployed tools\n\nYou might encounter technical implementation challenges, such as document processing complexity:\n\nVariable document quality – Scanned PDFs, handwritten annotations, and corrupted files require preprocessing strategies\nFormat diversity – Legal documents span emails, contracts, court filings, and multimedia content requiring different processing approaches\nScale management – Large cases involving over 100,000 documents require careful resource planning and concurrent processing optimization\n\nThe system integration also has specific requirements:\n\nLegacy system compatibility – Most law firms use established case management systems that need seamless integration\nAuthentication workflows – Multi-role access (attorneys, paralegals, clients) with different permission levels\nAI confidence thresholds – Determining when human review is required based on processing confidence scores\n\nAdditionally, consider your human/AI collaboration framework. The most successful eDiscovery implementations maintain human oversight at critical decision points. Although Amazon Bedrock Agents excels at automating routine tasks like document classification and metadata extraction, legal professionals remain essential for the following factors:\n\nComplex legal interpretations requiring contextual understanding\nPrivilege determinations that impact case strategy\nQuality control of AI-generated insights\nStrategic analysis of document relationships and case implications\n\nThis collaborative approach optimizes the eDiscovery process—AI handles time-consuming data processing while legal professionals focus on high-stakes decisions requiring human judgment and expertise. For your implementation strategy, consider a phased deployment approach. Organizations should implement staged rollouts to minimize risk while building confidence:\n\nPilot programs using lower-risk document categories (routine correspondence, standard contracts)\nControlled expansion with specialized agents and broader user base\nFull deployment enabling complete multi-agent collaboration organization-wide\n\nLastly, consider the following success planning best practices:\n\nEstablish clear governance frameworks for model updates and version control\nCreate standardized testing protocols for new agent deployments\nDevelop escalation procedures for edge cases requiring human intervention\nImplement parallel processing during validation periods to maintain accuracy\n\nBy addressing these considerations upfront, legal teams can facilitate smoother implementation and maximize the benefits of AI-powered document analysis while maintaining the accuracy and oversight required for legal proceedings.\nClean up\nIf you decide to discontinue using the solution, complete the following steps to remove it and its associated resources deployed using AWS CloudFormation:\n\nOn the AWS CloudFormation console, choose Stacks in the navigation pane.\nLocate the stack you created during the deployment process (you assigned a name to it).\nSelect the stack and choose Delete.\n\nResults\nAmazon Bedrock Agents transforms eDiscovery from time-intensive manual processes into efficient AI-powered operations, delivering measurable operational improvements across business services organizations. With a multi-agent architecture, organizations can process documents in 1–2 minutes compared to 2–4 hours of manual review for similar documents, achieving a 60–70% reduction in review time while maintaining accuracy and compliance requirements. A representative implementation from the financial services sector demonstrates this transformative potential: a major institution transformed their compliance review process from a 448-page manual workflow requiring over 10,000 hours to an automated system that reduced external audit times from 1,000 to 300–400 hours and internal audits from 800 to 320–400 hours. The institution now conducts 30–40 internal reviews annually with existing staff while achieving greater accuracy and consistency across assessments. These results demonstrate the potential across implementations: organizations implementing this solution can progress from initial efficiency gains in pilot phases to a 60–70% reduction in review time at full deployment. Beyond time savings, the solution delivers strategic advantages, including resource optimization that helps legal professionals focus on high-value analysis rather than routine document processing, improved compliance posture through systematic identification of privileged communications, and future-ready infrastructure that adapts to evolving legal technology requirements.\nConclusion\nThe combination of Amazon Bedrock multi-agent collaboration, real-time processing capabilities, and the extensible architecture provided in this post offers legal teams immediate operational benefits while positioning them for future AI advancements—creating the powerful synergy of AI efficiency and human expertise that defines modern legal practice.\nTo learn more about Amazon Bedrock, refer to the following resources:\n\nGitHub repo: Amazon Bedrock Workshop\nAmazon Bedrock User Guide\nWorkshop: GenAI for AWS Cloud Operations\nWorkshop: Using generative AI on AWS for diverse content types\n\n\nAbout the authors\nPuneeth Ranjan Komaragiri is a Principal Technical Account Manager at AWS.

      "description": "This post is co-written with Bogdan Arsenie and Nick Mattei from PerformLine.\nPerformLine operates within the marketing compliance industry, a specialized subset of the broader compliance software market, which includes various compliance solutions like anti-money laundering (AML), know your customer (KYC), and others. Specifically, marketing compliance refers to adhering to regulations and guidelines set by government agencies that make sure a company’s marketing, advertising, and sales content and communications are truthful, accurate, and not misleading for consumers. PerformLine is the leading service providing comprehensive compliance oversight across marketing, sales, and partner channels. As pioneers of the marketing compliance industry, PerformLine has conducted over 1.1 billion compliance observations over the past 10+ years, automating the entire compliance process—from pre-publication review of materials to continuous monitoring of consumer-facing channels such as websites, emails, and social media. Trusted by consumer finance brands and global organizations, PerformLine uses AI-driven solutions to protect brands and their consumers, transforming compliance efforts into a competitive advantage.\n“Discover. Monitor. Act. This isn’t just our tagline—it’s the foundation of our innovation at PerformLine,” says PerformLine’s CTO Bogdan Arsenie. PerformLine’s engineering team brings these principles to life by developing AI-powered technology solutions. In this post, PerformLine and AWS explore how PerformLine used Amazon Bedrock to accelerate compliance processes, generate actionable insights, and provide contextual data—delivering the speed and accuracy essential for large-scale oversight.\nThe problem\nOne of PerformLine’s enterprise customers needed a more efficient process for running compliance checks on newly launched product pages, particularly those that integrate multiple products within the same visual and textual framework. These complex pages often feature overlapping content that can apply to one product, several products, or even all of them at once, necessitating a context-aware interpretation that mirrors how a typical consumer would view and interact with the content. By adopting AWS and the architecture discussed in this post, PerformLine can retrieve and analyze these intricate pages through AI-driven processing, generating detailed insights and contextual data that capture the nuanced interplay between various product elements. After the relevant information is extracted and structured, it’s fed directly into their rules engine, enabling robust compliance checks. This accomplishes a seamless flow, from data ingestion to rules-based analysis. It not only preserves the depth of each product’s presentation but also delivers the speed and accuracy critical to large-scale oversight. Monitoring millions of webpages daily for compliance demands a system that can intelligently parse, extract, and analyze content at scale—much like the approach PerformLine has developed for their enterprise customers. In this dynamic landscape, the ever-evolving nature of web content challenges traditional static parsing, requiring a context-aware and adaptive solution. This architecture not only processes bulk data offline but also delivers near real-time performance for one-time requests, dynamically scaling to manage the diverse complexity of each page. By using AI-powered inference, PerformLine provides comprehensive coverage of every product and marketing element across the web, while striking a careful balance between accuracy, performance, and cost.\nSolution overview\nWith this flexible, adaptable solution, PerformLine can tackle even the most challenging webpages, providing comprehensive coverage when extracting and analyzing web content with multiple products. At the same time, by combining consistency with the adaptability of foundation models (FMs), PerformLine can maintain reliable performance across the diverse range of products and websites their customers monitor. This dual focus on agility and operational consistency makes sure their customers benefit from robust compliance checks and data integrity, without sacrificing the speed or scale needed to remain competitive.\nPerformLine’s upstream ingestion pipeline efficiently collects millions of web pages and their associated metadata in a batch process. Downstream assets are submitted to PerformLine’s rules engine and compliance review processes. It was imperative that they not disrupt those processes or introduce cascading changes for this solution.\nPerformLine decided to use generative AI and Amazon Bedrock to address their core challenges. Amazon Bedrock allows for a broad selection of models, including Amazon Nova. Amazon Bedrock is continuously expanding feature sets around using FMs at scale. This provides a reliable foundation to build a highly available and efficient content processing system.\nPerformLine’s solution incorporates the following key components:\n\nAI inference with Amazon Bedrock – Provides seamless access to FMs for content extraction and analysis\nApplication inference profiles – Enables precise tracking and optimization of inference costs\nEvent-driven serverless processing pipeline –Provides a lightweight, scalable approach to handling dynamic workloads using Amazon EventBridge, Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and Amazon DynamoDB.\nPrompt management in Bedrock – Supports versioning, testing, and deployment of prompts for improved AI consistency and control\nTask orchestration – Uses Amazon SQS to manage work queues efficiently, facilitating smooth and scalable task execution\n\nPerformLine implemented a scalable, serverless event-driven architecture (shown in the following diagram) that seamlessly integrates with their existing system, requiring less than a day to develop and deploy. This made it possible to focus on prompt optimization, evaluation, and cost management rather than infrastructure overhead. This architecture allows PerformLine to dynamically parse, extract, and analyze web content with high reliability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency.\n\n\nThe system implements multiple queue types (Incoming, DLQ, Results) and includes error handling mechanisms. Data flows through various AWS services including: Amazon RDS for initial data storage Amazon MQ RabbitMQ for message handling Amazon S3 for asset storage Amazon EventBridge for event management Amazon SQS for queue management AWS Lambda for serverless processing Amazon DynamoDB for NoSQL data storage\n\nPerformLine’s process consists of several steps, including processing (Step 1), event trigger and storage (Steps 2–6), structured output and storage (Step 7), and downstream processing and compliance checks (Steps 8–9):\n\nMillions of pages are processed by an upstream extract, transform, and load (ETL) process from PerformLine’s core systems running on the AWS Cloud.\nWhen a page is retrieved, it triggers an event in the compliance check system.\nAmazon S3 allows for storage of the data from a page according to metadata.\nEventBridge uses event-driven processing to route Amazon S3 events to Amazon SQS.\nAmazon SQS queues messages for processing and enables messages to be retried on failure.\nA Lambda Function consumes SQS messages and also scales dynamically to handle even unpredictable workloads: \n  \nThis function uses Amazon Bedrock to perform extraction and generative AI analysis of the content from Amazon SQS. Amazon Bedrock offers the greatest flexibility to choose the right model for the job. For PerformLine’s use case, Amazon’s Nova Pro was best suited for complex requests that require a powerful model but still allows for a high performance to cost ratio. Anthropic’s Claude Haiku model allows for optimized quick calls, where a fast response is paramount for additional processing if needed. Amazon Bedrock features, including Amazon Bedrock Prompt Management and inference profiles are used to increase input code variability without affecting output and reduce complexity in usage of FMs through Amazon Bedrock.\nThe function stores customer-defined product schemas in Amazon DynamoDB, enabling dynamic large language model (LLM) targeting and schema-driven output generation.\n \nAmazon S3 stores the extracted data, which is formatted as structured JSON adhering to the target schema.\nEventBridge forwards Amazon S3 events to Amazon SQS, making extracted data available for downstream processing.\nCompliance checks and business rules, running on other PerformLine’s systems, are applied to validate and enforce regulatory requirements.\n\nCost optimizations\nThe solution offers several cost optimizations, including change data capture (CDC) on the web and strategic multi-pass inference. After a page’s content has been analyzed and formatted, it’s written back to a partition that includes a metadata hash of the asset. This enables upstream processes to determine whether a page has already been processed and if its content has changed. The key benefits of this approach include:\n\nAlleviating redundant processing of the same pages, contributing to PerformLine experiencing a 15% workload reduction in human evaluation tasks. This frees time for human evaluators and allows them focus on critical pages rather than all the pages.\nAvoiding reprocessing unchanged pages, dynamically reducing PerformLine’s analysts’ workload by over 50% in addition to deduplication gains.\n\nLLM inference costs can escalate at scale, but context and carefully structured prompts are critical for accuracy. To optimize costs while maintaining precision, PerformLine implemented a multi-pass approach using Amazon Bedrock:\n\nInitial filtering with Amazon Nova Micro – This lightweight model efficiently identifies relevant products with minimal cost.\nTargeted extraction with Amazon Nova Lite – Identified products are batched into smaller groups and passed to Amazon Nova Lite for deeper analysis. This keeps PerformLine within token limits while improving extraction accuracy.\nIncreased accuracy through context-aware processing – By first identifying the target content and then processing it in smaller batches, PerformLine significantly improved accuracy while minimizing token consumption.\n\nUse of Amazon Bedrock\nDuring initial testing, PerformLine quickly realized the need for a more scalable approach to prompt management. Manually tracking multiple prompt versions and templates became inefficient as PerformLine iterated and collaborated.\nAmazon Bedrock’s Prompt Management service provided a centralized solution, enabling them to version, manage, and seamlessly deploy prompts to production. After the prompts are deployed, they can be dynamically referenced in AWS Lambda, allowing for flexible configuration. Additionally, by using Amazon Bedrock application profile inference endpoints, PerformLine can dynamically adjust the models the Lambda function invokes, track cost per invocation, and attribute costs to specific application instances through setting up cost tags.\nTo streamline model interactions, PerformLine chose the Amazon Bedrock Converse API which provides a developer-friendly, standardized interface for model invocation. When combined with inference endpoints and prompt management, a Lambda function using the Amazon Bedrock Converse API becomes highly configurable—PerformLine developers can rapidly test new models and prompts, evaluate results, and iterate without needing to rebuild or redeploy. The simplification of prompt management and ability to deploy various models through Amazon Bedrock is shown in the following diagram.\n\n\nComprehensive AWS ML model configuration architecture highlighting three main components: Inference System: Model ID integration Profile configuration Content management Inference settings Prompt Management: Version control (V1 and Draft versions) Publish ID tracking Model A specifications Store configurations Environment Control: Separate PROD and DEV paths Environment-specific parameter stores Invoke ID management Engineering iteration tracking\n\nFuture plans and enhancements\nPerformLine is excited to dive into additional Amazon Bedrock features, including prompt caching and Amazon Bedrock Flows.\nWith prompt caching, users can checkpoint prompt tokens, effectively caching context for reuse in subsequent API calls. Prompt caching on Amazon Bedrock offers up to 85% latency improvements and 90% cost reduction in comparison to calls without prompt caching. PerformLine sees prompt caching as a feature that will become the standard moving forward. They have a number of use cases for their data, and having the ability to apply further analysis on the same content at a lower cost creates new opportunities for feature expansion and development.\nAmazon Bedrock Flows is a visual workflow builder that enables users to orchestrate multi-step generative AI tasks by connecting FMs and APIs without extensive coding. Amazon Bedrock Flows is a next step in simplifying PerformLine’s orchestration of knowledge bases, prompt caching, and even Amazon Bedrock agents in the future. Creating flows can help reduce time to feature deployment and maintenance.\nSummary\nPerformLine has implemented a highly scalable, serverless, AI-driven architecture that enhances efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and compliance in the web content processing pipeline. By using Amazon Bedrock, EventBridge, Amazon SQS, Lambda, and DynamoDB, they have built a solution that can dynamically scale, optimize AI inference costs, and reduce redundant processing—all while maintaining operational flexibility and compliance integrity. Based on their current volume and workflow, PerformLine is projected to process between 1.5 to 2 million pages daily, from which they expect to extract approximately 400,000 to 500,000 products. Additionally, PerformLine anticipates applying rules to each asset, resulting in about 500,000 rule observations that will require review each day.Throughout the design process PerformLine made sure their solution remains as simple as possible while still delivering operational flexibility and integrity. This approach minimizes complexity, enhances maintainability, and accelerates deployment, empowering them to adapt quickly to evolving business needs without unnecessary overhead.\nBy using a serverless AI-driven architecture built on Amazon Bedrock, PerformLine helps their customers tackle even the most complex, multi-product webpages with unparalleled accuracy and efficiency. This holistic approach interprets visual and textual elements as a typical consumer would, verifying that every product variant is accurately assessed for compliance. The resulting insights are then fed directly into a rules engine, enabling rapid, data-driven decisions. For PerformLine’s customers, this means less redundant processing, lower operational costs, and a dramatically simplified compliance workflow, all without compromising on speed or accuracy. By reducing the overhead of large-scale data analysis and streamlining compliance checks, PerformLine’s solution ultimately frees teams to focus on driving innovation and delivering value.\n\nAbout the authors\nBogdan Arsenie is the Chief Technology Officer at PerformLine, with over two decades of experience leading technological innovation across digital advertising, big data, mobile gaming, and social engagement.

      "link": "https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/boost-cold-start-recommendations-with-vllm-on-aws-trainium/",
      "description": "Cold start in recommendation systems goes beyond just new user or new item problems—it’s the complete absence of personalized signals at launch. When someone first arrives, or when fresh content appears, there’s no behavioral history to tell the engine what they care about, so everyone ends up in broad generic segments. That not only dampens click-through and conversion rates, it can drive users away before a system ever gets a chance to learn their tastes. Standard remedies—collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, or popularity lists—lack the nuance to bridge that signal gap, and their one-size-fits-all suggestions quickly feel stale. Imagine, instead, if you could generate detailed interest profiles from day one. By tapping into large language models (LLMs) for zero-shot reasoning, you can synthesize rich, context-aware user and item embeddings without waiting for weeks of interaction data—turning a cold start into a warm welcome.\nIn this post, we demonstrate how to use vLLM for scalable inference and use AWS Deep Learning Containers (DLC) to streamline model packaging and deployment. We’ll generate interest expansions through structured prompts, encode them into embeddings, retrieve candidates with FAISS, apply validation to keep results grounded, and frame the cold-start challenge as a scientific experiment—benchmarking LLM and encoder pairings, iterating rapidly on recommendation metrics, and showing clear ROI for each configuration.\nSolution overview\nWe build our cold-start solution on Amazon EC2 Trainium chips. To streamline model deployment, we use DLCs with the AWS Neuron SDK, which installs Neuron-optimized PyTorch modules and includes the latest AWS Trainium drivers and runtime pre-installed.\n\n\nFigure : Cold-start recommendation pipeline on AWS Trainium with vLLM & NxD\n\nSharding large models across multiple Trainium chips is handled by the distributed library used by Neuron, NeuronX Distributed (NxD), which integrates seamlessly with vLLM. NxD manages model partitions across multiple instances with minimal code changes, enabling parallel inference of even 70B parameter LLMs. This combination—Trainium chips, Neuron Tools, and vLLM—gives machine learning (ML) engineers a flexible, cost-efficient, production-ready solution for experimenting with different LLM and encoder configurations and delivers rapid iteration on recommendation quality metrics without modifying core model code.\nIn the next section, we orchestrate our experiments in a Jupyter notebook—providing a reproducible, end-to-end workflow from loading data and engineering structured prompts to generating embeddings and retrieving candidates with FAISS—complete with interactive charts to visualize recommendation performance. Then, in the production deep-dive, we walk through a reference implementation that packages your Neuron-optimized LLM and encoder as DLC images and deploys them on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) with autoscaling, so your inference layer automatically adapts to demand while optimizing cost and performance.\nExpanding user interest profiles with LLMs\nIn this post, we use the Amazon Book Reviews dataset (mohamedbakhet/amazon-books-reviews) from Kaggle, which provides real-world user reviews and metadata for tens of thousands of books. This rich collection lets us simulate cold-start scenarios—where a brand-new user has only a single review or like—and evaluate how well our interest expansions, powered by distilled versions of Meta’s Llama 8B and 70B models, generate rich user profiles. We use an LLM to enrich a new user’s profile from minimal initial data. For example, if a user has only reviewed one science fiction novel, the LLM infers related subtopics—such as galactic empires, cyberpunk dystopias, or space exploration—that the user is likely to enjoy. We use structured prompts that embed the user’s existing activity into a concise instruction to verify consistency and relevance, as demonstrated in the following example:\n\nprompt = (\nf\"The user has shown interest in: {user_review_category}.\\n\"\n\"Suggest 3–5 related book topics they might enjoy.\\n\"\n\"Respond with a JSON list of topic keywords.\"\n)\nexpanded_topics = llm.generate([prompt])[0].text\n\nBy constraining the LLM’s output format—asking it to return a JSON array of topic keywords—we avoid free‑form tangents and obtain a predictable list of interest expansions. Modern generative models, such as Meta’s Llama, possess broad domain knowledge and human‑like reasoning, enabling them to connect related concepts and serve as powerful cold‑start boosters by inferring deep user preferences from a single review. These synthetic interests become new signals for our recommendation pipeline, allowing us to retrieve and rank books from the Amazon Reviews collection even with minimal user history. You can experiment with Llama variants ranging from one‑billion to seventy‑billion parameters to identify which model yields the most discriminative and relevant expansions. Those findings will guide our choice of model for production and determine the size and scale of the Amazon EC2 Trainium and Inferentia instances we provision, setting us up for live user A/B tests to validate performance in real‑world settings.\nEncoding user interests and retrieving relevant content\nAfter we have our expanded interests, the next step is to turn both those interests and our catalog of books into vectors that we can compare. We explore three sizes of the Google T5 encoder—base, large and XL—to see how embedding dimensionality affects matching quality. The following are the steps:\n\nLoad the encoder for each size\nEncode book summaries into a single NumPy matrix and normalize it\nBuild a FAISS index on those normalized vectors for fast nearest‑neighbor search\nEncode the expanded interest text the same way and query FAISS to retrieve the top k most similar books\n\n\nfrom transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5EncoderModel\nimport faiss\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Our dataset of book summaries\ncontent_texts = df[\"review/summary\"].tolist()\nencoder_sizes = [\"t5-base\", \"t5-large\", \"t5-xl\"]\ntop_k = 5\n\nfor size in encoder_sizes:\n    # 1. Load the tokenizer and encoder model for this size\n    tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(size)\n    model = T5EncoderModel.from_pretrained(size)\n\n    # 2. Encode all content into embeddings and normalize\n    inputs = tokenizer(content_texts, return_tensors=\"pt\", truncation=True, padding=True)\n    outputs = model(**inputs)\n    content_embs = outputs.last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1).detach().cpu().numpy().astype(\"float32\")\n    faiss.normalize_L2(content_embs)\n\n    # 3. Build a FAISS index using inner-product (equivalent to cosine on unit vectors)\n    index = faiss.IndexFlatIP(content_embs.shape[1])\n    index.add(content_embs)\n\n    # 4. Encode a single expanded interest and query the index\n    interest = \"space opera with political intrigue\"\n    enc = tokenizer([interest], return_tensors=\"pt\", truncation=True, padding=True)\n    interest_emb = model(**enc).last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1).detach().cpu().numpy().astype(\"float32\")\n    faiss.normalize_L2(interest_emb)\n\n    distances, indices = index.search(interest_emb, top_k)\n    recommendations = [content_texts[i] for i in indices[0]]\n\n    print(f\"\\nTop {top_k} recommendations using {size}:\")\n    for title in recommendations:\n        print(\" -\", title)\n\nYou can compare how each encoder scale affects both the average FAISS distance (that is, how far apart your interest is from the content) and the actual recommended titles. Swapping in a different encoder family—such as SentenceTransformers—is as straightforward as replacing the model and tokenizer imports.\nMeasuring and improving recommendation quality\nNow that we’ve generated FAISS indexes for every LLM‑encoder pairing and computed the mean distance between each expanded interest query and its top 10 neighbors, we know exactly how tightly or loosely each model’s embeddings cluster. The following chart shows those average distances for each combination—revealing that 1B and 3B models collapse to almost zero, while 8B and 70B models (especially with larger encoders) produce progressively higher distances, signifying richer, more discriminative signals for recommendation.\n\n\nFigure : Average FAISS distance by model and encoder\n\nThe chart shows that the 1B and 3B models yield an average FAISS distance of zero, meaning their expanded‑interest embeddings are essentially identical and offer no differentiation. By contrast, the 8B model produces a distance of about 0.5 with t5‑base, rising further with t5‑large and t5‑xl, which demonstrates that larger encoders capture more of the model’s nuance. The 70B model only adds a small boost—and only with the XL encoder—so its extra cost yields limited benefit.\nIn practical terms, a Llama 8B LLM paired with a base or large T5 encoder delivers clear separation in embedding space without the higher inference time and resource usage of a 70B model.\nComparing model and encoder impact on embedding spread\nTo see how LLM size and encoder scale shape our embedding space, you can measure—for each LLM and encoder  pair—the mean FAISS distance from a representative expanded interest vector to its top 10 neighbors. The following bar chart plots those averages side by side. You can instantly spot that 1B and 3B collapse to zero, 8B jumps to around 0.5 and rises with larger encoders, and 70B only adds a small extra spread at the XL scale. This helps you choose the smallest combination that still gives you the embedding diversity needed for effective cold‑start recommendations.\n\n\nFigure : FAISS distance by LLM and encoder size\n\nEvaluating recommendation overlap across Llama variations and encoders to balance consistency and novelty\nIn the next analysis, you build a basic recommend_books helper that, for various LLM sizes and encoder choices, loads the corresponding expanded‑interest DataFrame, reads its FAISS index, reconstructs the first embedding as a stand‑in query, and returns the top-k book titles. Using this helper, we first measure how much each pair of encoders agrees on recommendations for a single LLM—comparing base compared to large, base compared to XL, and large compared XL—and then, separately, how each pair of LLM sizes aligns for a fixed encoder. Finally, we focus on the 8B model (shown in the following figure) and plot a heatmap of its encoder overlaps, which shows that base and large share about 40% of their top 5 picks while XL diverges more—illustrating how changing the encoder shifts the balance between consistency and novelty in the recommendations.\n\n\nFigure : 8B model: encoder overlap heatmap\n\nFor the 8B model, the heatmap shows that t5_base and t5_large share 40% of their top 5 recommendations, t5_base and t5_xl also overlap 40%, while t5_large vs t5_xl overlap only 20%, indicating that the XL encoder introduces the greatest amount of novel titles compared to the other pairs.\nTweaking tensor_parallel_size for optimal cost performance\nTo balance inference speed against resource cost, we measured how increasing Neuron tensor parallelism affects latency when expanding user interests with the Llama 3.1 8B model on a trn1.32xlarge instance. We ran the same zero‑shot expansion workload at tensor_parallel_size values of 2, 8, 16, and 32. As shown in the first chart, P50 Latency falls by 74 %—from 2,480 ms at TP = 2 to 650 ms at TP = 16—then inches lower to 532 ms at TP = 32 (an additional 18 % drop). The following cost-to-performance chart shows that beyond TP = 16, doubling parallelism roughly doubles cost for only a 17 % further latency gain.\n\n\nFigure : Latency compared to tensor parallel size\n\nIn practice, setting tensor_parallel_size to 16 delivers the best trade‑off: you capture most of the speed‑up from model sharding while avoiding the sharply diminishing returns and higher core‑hour costs that come with maximal parallelism, as shown in the following figure.\n\n\nFigure : Cost-performance compared to tensor parallel size\n\nThe preceding figure visualizes the cost-to-performance ratio of the Llama 8B tests, emphasizing that TP=16 offers the most balanced efficiency before the benefits plateau.\nWhat’s next?\nNow that we have determined the models and encoders to use, as well as the optimal configuration to use with our dataset, such as sequence size and batch size, the next step is to deploy the models and define a production workflow that generates expanded interest that is encoded and ready for match with more content.\nConclusion\nThis post showed how AWS Trainium, the Neuron SDK, and scalable LLM inference can tackle cold-start challenges by enriching sparse user profiles for better recommendations from day one.\nImportantly, our experiments highlight that larger models and encoders don’t always mean better outcomes. While they can produce richer signals, the gains often don’t justify the added cost. You might find that an 8B LLM with a T5-large encoder strikes the best balance between performance and efficiency.\nRather than assuming bigger is better, this approach helps teams identify the optimal model-encoder pair—delivering high-quality recommendations with cost-effective infrastructure.\n\nAbout the authors\nYahav Biran is a Principal Architect at AWS, focusing on large-scale AI workloads.

      "description": "Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved, becoming integral to applications ranging from conversational AI to complex reasoning tasks. However, as models grow in size and capability, effectively evaluating their performance has become increasingly challenging. Traditional benchmarking metrics like perplexity and BLEU scores often fail to capture the nuances of real-world interactions, making human-aligned evaluation frameworks crucial. Understanding how LLMs are assessed can lead to more reliable deployments and fair comparisons across different models.\nIn this post, we explore automated and human-aligned judging methods based on LLM-as-a-judge. LLM-as-a-judge refers to using a more powerful LLM to evaluate and rank responses generated by other LLMs based on predefined criteria such as correctness, coherence, helpfulness, or reasoning depth. This approach has become increasingly popular due to the scalability, consistency, faster iteration, and cost-efficiency compared to solely relying on human judges. We discuss different LLM-as-a-judge evaluation scenarios, including pairwise comparisons, where two models or responses are judged against each other, and single-response scoring, where individual outputs are rated based on predefined criteria. To provide concrete insights, we use MT-Bench and Arena-Hard, two widely used evaluation frameworks. MT-Bench offers a structured, multi-turn evaluation approach tailored for chatbot-like interactions, whereas Arena-Hard focuses on ranking LLMs through head-to-head response battles in challenging reasoning and instruction-following tasks. These frameworks aim to bridge the gap between automated and human judgment, making sure that LLMs aren’t evaluated solely based on synthetic benchmarks but also on practical use cases.\nThe repositories for MT-Bench and Arena-Hard were originally developed using OpenAI’s GPT API, primarily employing GPT-4 as the judge. Our team has expanded its functionality by integrating it with the Amazon Bedrock API to enable using Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet on Amazon as judge. In this post, we use both MT-Bench and Arena-Hard to benchmark Amazon Nova models by comparing them to other leading LLMs available through Amazon Bedrock.\nAmazon Nova models and Amazon Bedrock\nOur study evaluated all four models from the Amazon Nova family, including Amazon Nova Premier, which is the most recent addition to the family. Introduced at AWS re:Invent in December 2024, Amazon Nova models are designed to provide frontier-level intelligence with leading price-performance ratios. These models rank among the fastest and most economical options in their respective intelligence categories and are specifically optimized for powering enterprise generative AI applications in a cost-effective, secure, and reliable manner.\nThe understanding model family comprises four distinct tiers: Amazon Nova Micro (text-only, designed for ultra-efficient edge deployment), Amazon Nova Lite (multimodal, optimized for versatility), Amazon Nova Pro (multimodal, offering an ideal balance between intelligence and speed for most enterprise applications), and Amazon Nova Premier (multimodal, representing the most advanced Nova model for complex tasks and serving as a teacher for model distillation). Amazon Nova models support a wide range of applications, including coding, reasoning, and structured text generation.\nAdditionally, through Amazon Bedrock Model Distillation, customers can transfer the intelligence capabilities of Nova Premier to faster, more cost-effective models such as Nova Pro or Nova Lite, tailored to specific domains or use cases. This functionality is accessible through both the Amazon Bedrock console and APIs, including the Converse API and Invoke API.\nMT-Bench analysis\nMT-Bench is a unified framework that uses LLM-as-a-judge, based on a set of predefined questions. The evaluation questions are a set of challenging multi-turn open-ended questions designed to evaluate chat assistants. Users also have the flexibility to define their own question and answer pairs in a way that suits their needs. The framework presents models with challenging multi-turn questions across eight key domains:\n\nWriting\nRoleplay\nReasoning\nMathematics\nCoding\nData Extraction\nSTEM\nHumanities\n\nThe LLMs are evaluated using two types of evaluation:\n\nSingle-answer grading – This mode asks the LLM judge to grade and give a score to a model’s answer directly without pairwise comparison. For each turn, the LLM judge gives a score on a scale of 0–10. Then the average score is computed on all turns.\nWin-rate based grading – This mode uses two metrics: \n  \npairwise-baseline – Run a pairwise comparison against a baseline model.\npairwise-all – Run a pairwise comparison between all model pairs on all questions.\n \n\nEvaluation setup\nIn this study, we employed Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet as our LLM judge, given its position as one of the most advanced language models available at the time of our study. We focused exclusively on single-answer grading, wherein the LLM judge directly evaluates and scores model-generated responses without conducting pairwise comparisons.\nThe eight domains covered in our study can be broadly categorized into two groups: those with definitive ground truth and those without. Specifically, Reasoning, Mathematics, Coding, and Data Extraction fall into the former category because they typically have reference answers against which responses can be objectively evaluated. Conversely, Writing, Roleplay, STEM, and Humanities often lack such clear-cut ground truth. Here we provide an example question from the Writing and Math categories:\n\n{\n    \"question_id\": 81,\n    \"category\": \"writing\",\n    \"turns\": [\n        \"Compose an engaging travel blog post about a recent trip to Hawaii, \n        highlighting cultural experiences and must-see attractions.\", \n        \"Rewrite your previous response. Start every sentence with the letter A.\"\n    ]\n}\n{\n    \"question_id\": 111,\n    \"category\": \"math\",\n    \"turns\": [\n        \"The vertices of a triangle are at points (0, 0), (-1, 1), and (3, 3). \n         What is the area of the triangle?\",\n        \"What's area of the circle circumscribing the triangle?\"\n    ],\n    \"reference\": [\n        \"Area is 3\",\n        \"5pi\"\n    ]\n}\n\nTo account for this distinction, MT-Bench employs different judging prompts for each category (refer to the following GitHub repo), tailoring the evaluation process to the nature of the task at hand. As shown in the following evaluation prompt, for questions without a reference answer, MT-Bench adopts the single-v1 prompt, only passing the question and model-generated answer. When evaluating questions with a reference answer, it only passes the reference_answer, as shown in the single-math-v1 prompt.\n\n{\n    \"name\": \"single-v1\",\n    \"type\": \"single\",\n    \"system_prompt\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\",\n    \"prompt_template\": \n        \"[Instruction]\\nPlease act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of\n         the response provided by an AI assistant to the user question displayed below. \n         Your evaluation should consider factors such as the helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, \n         depth, creativity, and level of detail of the response.

The scores ranged from 8.0 to 8.6, with Amazon Nova Premier achieving the highest median score of 8.6, followed closely by Amazon Nova Pro at 8.5. Both Amazon Nova Lite and Nova Micro achieved respectable median scores of 8.0.\nWhat distinguishes these models beyond their median scores is their performance consistency. Nova Premier demonstrated the most stable performance across evaluation categories with a narrow min-max margin of 1.5 (ranging from 7.94 to 9.47). In comparison, Nova Pro showed greater variability with a min-max margin of 2.7 (from 6.44 to 9.13). Similarly, Nova Lite exhibited more consistent performance than Nova Micro, as evidenced by their respective min-max margins. For enterprise deployments where response time is critical, Nova Lite and Nova Micro excel with less than 6-second average latencies for single question-answer generation. This performance characteristic makes them particularly suitable for edge deployment scenarios and applications with strict latency requirements. When factoring in their lower cost, these models present compelling options for many practical use cases where the slight reduction in performance score is an acceptable trade-off.\nInterestingly, our analysis revealed that Amazon Nova Premier, despite being the largest model, demonstrates superior token efficiency. It generates more concise responses that consume up to 190 fewer tokens for single question-answer generation than comparable models. This observation aligns with research indicating that more sophisticated models are generally more effective at filtering irrelevant information and structuring responses efficiently.\nThe narrow 0.6-point differential between the highest and lowest performing models suggests that all Amazon Nova variants demonstrate strong capabilities. Although larger models such as Nova Premier offer marginally better performance with greater consistency, smaller models provide compelling alternatives when latency and cost are prioritized. This performance profile gives developers flexibility to select the appropriate model based on their specific application requirements.\nThe following graph summarizes the overall performance scores and latency for all four models.\n\nThe following table shows token consumption and cost analysis for Amazon Nova Models.\n\n\n\nModel\nAvg. total tokens per query\nPrice per 1k input tokens\nAvg. cost per query (cents)\n\n\nAmazon Nova Premier\n2154\n$0.0025\n$5.4\n\n\nAmazon Nova Pro\n2236\n$0.0008\n$1.8\n\n\nAmazon Nova Lite\n2343\n$0.00006\n$0.14\n\n\nAmazon Nova Micro\n2313\n$0.000035\n$0.08\n\n\n\nCategory-specific model comparison\nThe following radar plot compares the Amazon Nova models across all eight domains.\n\nThe radar plot reveals distinct performance patterns across the Amazon Nova model family, with a clear stratification across domains. Nova Premier consistently outperforms its counterparts, showing particular strengths in Math, Reasoning, Humanities, and Extraction, where it achieves scores approaching or exceeding 9. Nova Pro follows closely behind Premier in most categories, maintaining competitive performance especially in Writing and Coding, while showing more pronounced gaps in Humanities, Reasoning, and Math. Both Nova Lite and Micro demonstrate similar performance profiles to each other, with their strongest showing in Roleplay, and their most significant limitations in Humanities and Math, where the differential between Premier and the smaller models is most pronounced (approximately 1.5–3 points).\nThe consistent performance hierarchy across all domains (Premier > Pro > Lite ≈ Micro) aligns with model size and computational resources, though the magnitude of these differences varies significantly by category. Math and reasoning emerge among the most discriminating domains for model capability assessment and suggest substantial benefit from the additional scale of Amazon Nova Premier. However, workloads focused on creative content (Roleplay, Writing) provide the most consistent performance across the Nova family and suggest smaller models as compelling options given their latency and cost benefits. This domain-specific analysis offers practitioners valuable guidance when selecting the appropriate Nova model based on their application’s primary knowledge requirements.\nIn this study, we adopted Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet as the single LLM judge. However, although Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet is a popular choice for LLM judging due to its capabilities, studies have shown that it does exhibit certain bias (for example, it prefers longer responses). If permitted by time and resources, consider adopting a multi-LLM judge evaluation framework to effectively reduce biases intrinsic to individual LLM judges and increase evaluation reliability.\nArena-Hard-Auto analysis\nArena-Hard-Auto is a benchmark that uses 500 challenging prompts as a dataset to evaluate different LLMs using LLM-as-a-judge. The dataset is curated through an automated pipeline called BenchBuilder, which uses LLMs to automatically cluster, grade, and filter open-ended prompts from large, crowd-sourced datasets such as Chatbot-Arena to enable continuous benchmarking without a human in the loop. The paper reports that the new evaluation metrics provide three times higher separation of model performances compared to MT-Bench and achieve a 98.6% correlation with human preference rankings.\nTest framework and methodology\nThe Arena-Hard-Auto benchmarking framework evaluates different LLMs using a pairwise comparison. Each model’s performance is quantified by comparing it against a strong baseline model, using a structured, rigorous setup to generate reliable and detailed judgments. We use the following components for the evaluation:\n\nPairwise comparison setup – Instead of evaluating models in isolation, they’re compared directly with a strong baseline model. This baseline provides a fixed standard, making it straightforward to understand how the models perform relative to an already high-performing model.\nJudge model with fine-grained categories – A powerful model (Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet) is used as a judge. This judge doesn’t merely decide which model is better, it also categorizes the comparison into five detailed preference labels. By using this nuanced scale, large performance gaps are penalized more heavily than small ones, which helps separate models more effectively based on performance differences: \n  \nA >> B (A is significantly better than B)\nA > B (A is better than B)\nA ~= B (A and B are similar)\nB > A (B is better than A)\nB >> A (B is significantly better than A)\n \nChain-of-thought (CoT) prompting – CoT prompting encourages the judge model to explain its reasoning before giving a final judgment. This process can lead to more thoughtful and reliable evaluations by helping the model analyze each response in depth rather than making a snap decision.\nTwo-game setup to avoid position bias – To minimize bias that might arise from a model consistently being presented first or second, each model pair is evaluated twice, swapping the order of the models. This way, if there’s a preference for models in certain positions, the setup controls for it. The total number of judgments is doubled (for example, 500 queries x 2 positions = 1,000 judgments).\nBradley-Terry model for scoring – After the comparisons are made, the Bradley-Terry model is applied to calculate each model’s final score. This model uses pairwise comparison data to estimate the relative strength of each model in a way that reflects not only the number of wins but also the strength of wins. This scoring method is more robust than simply calculating win-rate because it accounts for pairwise outcomes across the models.\nBootstrapping for statistical stability – By repeatedly sampling the comparison results (bootstrapping), the evaluation becomes statistically stable. This stability is beneficial because it makes sure the model rankings are reliable and less sensitive to random variations in the data.\nStyle control – Certain style features like response length and markdown formatting are separated from content quality, using style controls, to provide a clearer assessment of each model’s intrinsic capabilities.\n\nThe original work focuses on pairwise comparison only. For our benchmarking, we also included our own implementation of single-score judgment, taking inspiration from MT-Bench. We again use Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet as the judge and use the following prompt for judging without a reference model:\n\n{\t\n\t\"system_prompt\": \n\t\t\"Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality \n\t\tof the response provided by an AI assistant to the user question \n\t\tdisplayed below. Your evaluation should consider factors \n\t\tsuch as the helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, depth, creativity, \n\t\tand level of detail of the response. \n\t\tBegin your evaluation by providing a short explanation. \n\t\tBe as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, \n\t\tyou must rate the response on a scale of 1 to 10 by strictly \n\t\tfollowing this format: \\\"[[rating]]\\\", for example: \\\"Rating: [[5]]\\\".\"\n}\n\nPerformance comparison\nWe evaluated five models, including Amazon Nova Premier, Amazon Nova Pro, Amazon Nova Lite, Amazon Nova Micro, DeepSeek-R1, and a strong reference model. The Arena-Hard benchmark generates confidence intervals by bootstrapping, as explained before. The 95% confidence interval shows the uncertainty of the models and is indicative of model performance. From the following plot, we can see that all the Amazon Nova models get a high pairwise Bradley-Terry score. It should be noted that the Bradley-Terry score for the reference model is 5; this is because Bradley-Terry scores are computed by pairwise comparisons where the reference model is one of the models in the pair. So, for the reference model, the score will be 50%, and because the total score is normalized between 0 and 10, the reference model has a score of 5.\n\nThe confidence interval analysis, as shown in the following table, was done to statistically evaluate the Amazon Nova model family alongside DeepSeek-R1, providing deeper insights beyond raw scores. Nova Premier leads the pack (8.36–8.72), with DeepSeek-R1 (7.99–8.30) and Nova Pro (7.72–8.12) following closely. The overlapping confidence intervals among these top performers indicate statistically comparable capabilities. Nova Premier demonstrates strong performance consistency with a tight confidence interval (−0.16, +0.20), while maintaining the highest overall scores. A clear statistical separation exists between these leading models and the purpose-built Nova Lite (6.51–6.98) and Nova Micro (5.68–6.14), which are designed for different use cases. This comprehensive analysis confirms the position of Nova Premier as a top performer, with the entire Nova family offering options across the performance spectrum to meet varied customer requirements and resource constraints.\n\n\n\nModel\nPairwise score 25th quartile \nPairwise score 75th quartile\nConfidence interval\n\n\nAmazon Nova Premier\n8.36\n8.72\n(−0.16, +0.20)\n\n\nAmazon Nova Pro\n7.72\n8.12\n(−0.18, +0.23)\n\n\nAmazon Nova Lite\n6.51\n6.98\n(−0.22, +0.25)\n\n\nAmazon Nova Micro\n5.68\n6.14\n(−0.21, +0.25)\n\n\nDeepSeek-R1\n7.99\n8.30\n(−0.15, +0.16)\n\n\n\nCost per output token is one of the contributors to the overall cost of the LLM model and impacts the usage. The cost was computed based on the average output tokens over the 500 responses. Although Amazon Nova Premier leads in performance (85.22), Nova Light and Nova Micro offer compelling value despite their wider confidence intervals. Nova Micro delivers 69% of the performance of Nova Premier at 89 times cheaper cost, while Nova Light achieves 79% of the capabilities of Nova Premier, at 52 times lower price. These dramatic cost efficiencies make the more affordable Nova models attractive options for many applications where absolute top performance isn’t essential, highlighting the effective performance-cost tradeoffs across the Amazon Nova family.\nConclusion\nIn this post, we explored the use of LLM-as-a-judge through MT-Bench and Arena-Hard benchmarks to evaluate model performance rigorously. We then compared Amazon Nova models against a leading reasoning model, that is, DeepSeek-R1 hosted on Amazon Bedrock, analyzing their capabilities across various tasks. Our findings indicate that Amazon Nova models deliver strong performance, especially in Extraction, Humanities, STEM, and Roleplay, while maintaining lower operational costs, making them a competitive choice for enterprises looking to optimize efficiency without compromising on quality. These insights highlight the importance of benchmarking methodologies in guiding model selection and deployment decisions in real-world applications.\nFor more information on Amazon Bedrock and the latest Amazon Nova models, refer to the Amazon Bedrock User Guide and Amazon Nova User Guide.

      "description": "At the AWS Summit in New York City, we introduced a comprehensive suite of model customization capabilities for Amazon Nova foundation models. Available as ready-to-use recipes on Amazon SageMaker AI, you can use them to adapt Nova Micro, Nova Lite, and Nova Pro across the model training lifecycle, including pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and alignment.\nIn this multi-post series, we will explore these customization recipes and provide a step-by-step implementation guide. We are starting with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO, an alignment technique that offers a straightforward way to tune model outputs with your preferences. DPO uses prompts paired with two responses—one preferred over the other—to guide the model toward outputs that better reflect your desired tone, style, or guidelines. You can implement this technique using either parameter-efficient or full model DPO, based on your data volume and cost considerations. The customized models can be deployed to Amazon Bedrock for inference using provisioned throughput. The parameter-efficient version supports on-demand inference. Nova customization recipes are available in SageMaker training jobs and SageMaker HyperPod, giving you flexibility to select the environment that best fits your infrastructure and scale requirements.\nIn this post, we present a streamlined approach to customizing Amazon Nova Micro with SageMaker training jobs.\nSolution overview\nThe workflow for using Amazon Nova recipes with SageMaker training jobs, as illustrated in the accompanying diagram, consists of the following steps:\n\nThe user selects a specific Nova customization recipe which provides comprehensive configurations to control Amazon Nova training parameters, model settings, and distributed training strategies. You can use the default configurations optimized for the SageMaker AI environment or customize them to experiment with different settings.\nThe user submits an API request to the SageMaker AI control plane, passing the Amazon Nova recipe configuration.\nSageMaker uses the training job launcher script to run the Nova recipe on a managed compute cluster.\nBased on the selected recipe, SageMaker AI provisions the required infrastructure, orchestrates distributed training, and, upon completion, automatically decommissions the cluster.\n\nThis streamlined architecture delivers a fully managed user experience, so you can quickly define Amazon Nova training parameters and select your preferred infrastructure using straightforward recipes, while SageMaker AI handles the end-to-end infrastructure management—within a pay-as-you-go pricing model that is only billed for the net training time in seconds.\n\nThe customized Amazon Nova model is subsequently deployed on Amazon Bedrock using the createcustommodel API within Bedrock – and can integrate with native tooling such as Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, Amazon Bedrock Guardrails, and Amazon Bedrock Agents.\nBusiness Use Case – Implementation Walk-through\nIn this post, we focus on adapting the Amazon Nova Micro model to optimize structured function calling for application-specific agentic workflows. We demonstrate how this approach can optimize Amazon Nova models for domain-specific use cases by a 81% increase in F1 score and up to 42% gains in ROUGE metrics. These improvements make the models more efficient in addressing a wide array of business applications, such as enabling customer support AI assistants to intelligently escalate queries, powering digital assistants for scheduling and workflow automation, and automating decision-making in sectors like ecommerce and financial services.\nAs shown in the following diagram, our approach uses DPO to align the Amazon Nova model with human preferences by presenting the model with pairs of responses—one preferred by human annotators and one less preferred—based on a given user query and available tool actions. The model is trained with the nvidia/When2Call dataset to increase the likelihood of the tool_call response, which aligns with the business goal of automating backend actions when appropriate. Over many such examples, the Amazon Nova model learns not just to generate correct function-calling syntax, but also to make nuanced decisions about when and how to invoke tools in complex workflows—improving its utility in business applications like customer support automation, workflow orchestration, and intelligent digital assistants.\n\nWhen training is complete, we evaluate the models using SageMaker training jobs with the appropriate evaluation recipe. An evaluation recipe is a YAML configuration file that defines how your Amazon Nova large language model (LLM) evaluation job will be executed. Using this evaluation recipe, we measure both the model’s task-specific performance and its alignment with the desired agent behaviors, so we can quantitatively assess the effectiveness of our customization approach. The following diagram illustrates how these stages can be implemented as two separate training job steps. For each step, we use built-in integration with Amazon CloudWatch to access logs and monitor system metrics, facilitating robust observability. After the model is trained and evaluated, we deploy the model using the Amazon Bedrock Custom Model Import functionality as part of step 3.\n\nPrerequisites\nYou must complete the following prerequisites before you can run the Amazon Nova Micro model fine-tuning notebook:\n\nMake the following quota increase requests for SageMaker AI. For this use case, you will need to request a minimum of 2 p5.48xlarge instance (with 8 x NVIDIA H100 GPUs) and scale to more p5.48xlarge instances (depending on time-to-train and cost-to-train trade-offs for your use case). On the Service Quotas console, request the following SageMaker AI quotas: \n  \nP5 instances (p5.48xlarge) for training job usage: 2\n \n(Optional) You can create an Amazon SageMaker Studio domain (refer to Use quick setup for Amazon SageMaker AI) to access Jupyter notebooks with the preceding role. (You can use JupyterLab in your local setup, too.)\nCreate an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with managed policies AmazonSageMakerFullAccess, AmazonS3FullAccess, and AmazonBedrockFullAccess to give required access to SageMaker AI and Amazon Bedrock to run the examples.\nAssign the following policy as the trust relationship to your IAM role:\n\n\n{\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n    \"Statement\": [\n        {\n            \"Sid\": \"\",\n            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n            \"Principal\": {\n                \"Service\": [\n                    \"bedrock.amazonaws.com\",\n                    \"sagemaker.amazonaws.com\"\n                ]\n            },\n            \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\nClone the GitHub repository with the assets for this deployment. This repository consists of a notebook that references training assets: \n  \ngit clone https://github.com/aws-samples/sagemaker-distributed-training-workshop.git\n\ncd sagemaker-distributed-training-workshop/18_sagemaker_training_recipes/nova\n \n\nNext, we run the notebook nova-micro-dpo-peft.ipynb to fine-tune the Amazon Nova model using DPO, and PEFT on SageMaker training jobs.\nPrepare the dataset\nTo prepare the dataset, you need to load the nvidia/When2Call dataset. This dataset provides synthetically generated user queries, tool options, and annotated preferences based on real scenarios, to train and evaluate AI assistants on making optimal tool-use decisions in multi-step scenarios.\nComplete the following steps to format the input in a chat completion format, and configure the data channels for SageMaker training jobs on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3):\n\nLoad the nvidia/When2Call dataset:\n\n\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\ndataset = load_dataset(\"nvidia/When2Call\", \"train_pref\", split=\"train\")\n\nThe DPO technique requires a dataset containing the following:\n\nUser prompts (e.g., “Write a professional email asking for a raise”)\nPreferred outputs (ideal responses)\nNon-preferred outputs (undesirable responses)\n\nThe following code is an example from the original dataset:\n\n\n\n\nAs part of data preprocessing, we convert the data into the format required by Amazon Nova Micro, as shown in the following code. For examples and specific constraints of the Amazon Nova format, see Preparing data for fine-tuning Understanding models.\n\n\nFor the full data conversion code, see here.\n\nSplit the dataset into train and test datasets:\n\n\nfrom datasets import Dataset, DatasetDict\nfrom random import randint\n\n...\n\ndataset = DatasetDict(\n    {\"train\": train_dataset, \"test\": test_dataset, \"val\": val_dataset}\n)\ntrain_dataset = dataset[\"train\"].map(\n    prepare_dataset, remove_columns=train_dataset.features\n)\n\ntest_dataset = dataset[\"test\"].map(\n    prepare_dataset, remove_columns=test_dataset.features\n)\n\n\nPrepare the training and test datasets for the SageMaker training job by saving them as .jsonl files, which is required by SageMaker HyperPod recipes for Amazon Nova, and constructing the Amazon S3 paths where these files will be uploaded:\n\n\n...\n\ntrain_dataset.to_json(\"./data/train/dataset.jsonl\")\ntest_dataset.to_json(\"./data/test/dataset.jsonl\")\n\n\ns3_client.upload_file(\n    \"./data/train/dataset.jsonl\", bucket_name, f\"{input_path}/train/dataset.jsonl\"\n)\ns3_client.upload_file(\n    \"./data/test/dataset.jsonl\", bucket_name, f\"{input_path}/test/dataset.jsonl\"\n)\n\nDPO training using SageMaker training jobs\nTo fine-tune the model using DPO and SageMaker training jobs with recipes, we use the PyTorch Estimator class. Start by setting the fine-tuning workload with the following steps:\n\nSelect the instance type and the container image for the training job:\n\n\ninstance_type = \"ml.p5.48xlarge\" \ninstance_count = 2\n\nimage_uri = (\n    f\"708977205387.dkr.ecr.{sagemaker_session.boto_session.region_name}.amazonaws.com/nova-fine-tune-repo:SM-TJ-DPO-latest\"\n)\n\n\nCreate the PyTorch Estimator to encapsulate the training setup from a selected Amazon Nova recipe:\n\n\n\nfrom sagemaker.pytorch import PyTorch\n\n# define Training Job Name\njob_name = \"train-nova-micro-dpo\"\n\nrecipe_overrides = {\n    \"training_config\": {\n        \"trainer\": {\"max_epochs\": 1},\n        \"model\": {\n            \"dpo_cfg\": {\"beta\": 0.1},\n            \"peft\": {\n                \"peft_scheme\": \"lora\",\n                \"lora_tuning\": {\n                    \"loraplus_lr_ratio\": 16.0,\n                    \"alpha\": 128,\n                    \"adapter_dropout\": 0.01,\n                },\n            },\n        },\n    },\n}\n\nestimator = PyTorch(\n    output_path=f\"s3://{bucket_name}/{job_name}\",\n    base_job_name=job_name,\n    role=role,\n    instance_count=instance_count,\n    instance_type=instance_type,\n    training_recipe=recipe,\n    recipe_overrides=recipe_overrides,\n    max_run=18000,\n    sagemaker_session=sess,\n    image_uri=image_uri,\n    disable_profiler=True,\n    debugger_hook_config=False,\n)\n\n\nYou can point to the specific recipe with the training_recipe parameter and override the recipe by providing a dictionary as recipe_overrides parameter.\nThe PyTorch Estimator class simplifies the experience by encapsulating code and training setup directly from the selected recipe.\nIn this example, training_recipe: fine-tuning/nova/nova_micro_p5_gpu_lora_dpo is defining the DPO fine-tuning setup with PEFT technique.\n\nSet up the input channels for the PyTorch Estimator by creating an TrainingInput objects from the provided S3 bucket paths for the training and test datasets:\n\n\nfrom sagemaker.inputs import TrainingInput\n\ntrain_input = TrainingInput(\n    s3_data=train_dataset_s3_path,\n    distribution=\"FullyReplicated\",\n    s3_data_type=\"Converse\",\n)\ntest_input = TrainingInput(\n    s3_data=test_dataset_s3_path,\n    distribution=\"FullyReplicated\",\n    s3_data_type=\"Converse\",\n)\n\n\nSubmit the training job using the fit function call on the created Estimator:\n\nestimator.fit(inputs={\"train\": train_input, \"validation\": test_input}, wait=True)\nYou can monitor the job directly from your notebook output. You can also refer the SageMaker AI console, which shows the status of the job and the corresponding CloudWatch logs for governance and observability, as shown in the following screenshots.\n\n\nSageMaker training jobs console\n\n\n\nSageMaker training jobs system metrics\n\nAfter the job is complete, the trained model weights will be available in an escrow S3 bucket. This secure bucket is controlled by Amazon and uses special access controls. You can access the paths shared in manifest files that are saved in a customer S3 bucket as part of the training process.\nEvaluate the fine-tuned model using the evaluation recipe\nTo assess model performance against benchmarks or custom datasets, we can use the Nova evaluation recipes and SageMaker training jobs to execute an evaluation workflow, by pointing to the model trained in the previous step. Among several supported benchmarks, such as mmlu, math, gen_qa, and llm_judge, in the following steps we are going to provide two options for  gen_qa and llm_judge tasks, which allow us to evaluate response accuracy, precision and model inference quality with the possibility to use our own dataset and compare results with the base model on Amazon Bedrock.\nOption A: Evaluate gen_qa task\n\nUse the code in the to prepare the dataset, structured in the following format as required by the evaluation recipe:\n\n\n\n{\n    \"system\": \"(Optional) String containing the system prompt that sets the behavior, role, or personality of the model\",\n    \"query\": \"String containing the input prompt\",\n    \"response\": \"String containing the expected model output\"\n}\n\n\n\nSave the dataset as .jsonl files, which is required by Amazon Nova evaluation recipes, and upload them to the Amazon S3 path:\n\n\n# Save datasets to s3\nval_dataset.to_json(\"./data/val/gen_qa.jsonl\")\n\ns3_client.upload_file(\n    \"./data/val/gen_qa.jsonl\", bucket_name, f\"{input_path}/val/gen_qa.jsonl\"\n)\n...\n\n\nCreate the evaluation recipe pointing to trained model, validation data, and the evaluation metrics applicable to your use case:\n\n\nmodel_path = \"<ESCROW_S3_PATH_MODEL_CHECKPOINTS>\"\n\nrecipe_content = f\"\"\"\nrun:\n  name: nova-micro-gen_qa-eval-job\n  model_type: amazon.nova-micro-v1:0:128k\n  model_name_or_path: {model_path}\n  replicas: 1\n  data_s3_path: {val_dataset_s3_path} # Required, input data s3 location\n\nevaluation:\n  task: gen_qa\n  strategy: gen_qa\n  metric: all\n    \ninference:\n  max_new_tokens: 4096\n  top_p: 0.9\n  temperature: 0.1\n\"\"\"\n\nwith open(\"eval-recipe.yaml\", \"w\") as f:\n  f.write(recipe_content)\n\n\nSelect the instance type, the container image for the evaluation job, and define the checkpoint path where the model will be stored. The recommended instance types for the Amazon Nova evaluation recipes are:  ml.g5.12xlarge for Amazon Nova Micro and Amazon Nova Lite, and ml.g5.48xlarge for Amazon Nova Pro:\n\n\ninstance_type = \"ml.g5.12xlarge\" \ninstance_count = 1\n\nimage_uri = (\n    f\"708977205387.dkr.ecr.{sagemaker_session.boto_session.region_name}.amazonaws.com/nova-evaluation-repo:SM-TJ-Eval-latest\"\n)\n\n\nCreate the PyTorch Estimator to encapsulate the evaluation setup from the created recipe:\n\n\nfrom sagemaker.pytorch import PyTorch\n\n# define Training Job Name\njob_name = \"train-nova-micro-eval\"\n\nestimator = PyTorch(\n    output_path=f\"s3://{bucket_name}/{job_name}\",\n    base_job_name=job_name,\n    role=role,\n    instance_count=instance_count,\n    instance_type=instance_type,\n    training_recipe=\"./eval-recipe.yaml\",\n    max_run=18000,\n    sagemaker_session=sagemaker_session,\n    image_uri=image_uri,\n    disable_profiler=True,\n    debugger_hook_config=False,\n)\n\n\nSet up the input channels for PyTorch Estimator by creating an TrainingInput objects from the provided S3 bucket paths for the validation dataset:\n\n\nfrom sagemaker.inputs import TrainingInput\n\neval_input = TrainingInput(\n    s3_data=val_dataset_s3_path,\n    distribution=\"FullyReplicated\",\n    s3_data_type=\"S3Prefix\",\n)\n\n\nSubmit the training job:\n\nestimator.fit(inputs={\"train\": eval_input}, wait=False)\nEvaluation metrics will be stored by the SageMaker training Job in your S3 bucket, under the specified output_path.\nThe following figure and accompanying table show the evaluation results against the base model for the gen_qa task:\n\n\n\n\n\nF1\nF1 QUASI\nROUGE 1\nROUGE 2\nROUGE L\n\n\nBase\n0.26\n0.37\n0.38\n0.28\n0.34\n\n\nFine-tuned\n0.46\n0.52\n0.52\n0.4\n0.46\n\n\n% Difference\n81%\n40%\n39%\n42%\n38%\n\n\n\nOption B: Evaluate llm_judge task\n\nFor the llm_judge task, structure the dataset with the below format, where response_A represents the ground truth and response_B represents our customized model output:\n\n\n{\n    \"prompt\": \"String containing the input prompt and instructions\",\n    \"response_A\": \"String containing the ground truth output\",\n    \"response_B\": \"String containing the customized model output\"\n}\n\n\n\nFollowing the same approach described for the gen_qa task, create an evaluation recipe specifically for the llm_judge task, by specifying judge as strategy:\n\n\nrecipe_content = f\"\"\"\nrun:\n  name: nova-micro-llm-judge-eval-job\n  model_type: amazon.nova-micro-v1:0:128k\n  model_name_or_path: \"nova-micro/prod\"\n  ...\n\nevaluation:\n  task: llm_judge\n  strategy: judge\n  metric: all\n\n...\n\"\"\"\n\nThe complete implementation including dataset preparation, recipe creation, and job submission steps, refer to the notebook nova-micro-dpo-peft.ipynb.\nThe following figure shows the results for the llm_judge task:\n\nThis graph shows the preference percentages when using an LLM as a judge to evaluate model performance across two different comparisons. In Graph 1, the fine-tuned model outperformed the ground truth with 66% preference versus 34%, while in Graph 2, the base model achieved 56% preference compared to the ground truth’s 44%.\nSummarized evaluation results\nOur fine-tuned model delivers significant improvements on the tool-calling task, outperforming the base model across all key evaluation metrics. Notably, the F1 score increased by 81%, while the F1 Quasi score improved by 35%, reflecting a substantial boost in both precision and recall. In terms of lexical overlap, the model demonstrated enhanced accuracy in matching generated answers to reference texts —tools to invoke and structure of the invoked function— achieving gains of 39% and 42% for ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 scores, respectively. The llm_judge evaluation further validates these improvements, with the fine-tuned model outputs being preferred in 66.2% against the ground truth outputs. These comprehensive results across multiple evaluation frameworks confirm the effectiveness of our fine-tuning approach in elevating model performance for real-world scenarios.\nDeploy the model on Amazon Bedrock\nTo deploy the fine-tuned model, we can use the Amazon Bedrock CreateCustomModel API and use Bedrock On-demand inference with the native model invocation tools. To deploy the model, complete the following steps:\n\nCreate a custom model, by pointing to the model checkpoints saved in the escrow S3 bucket:\n\n\n...\nmodel_path = \"<ESCROW_S3_PATH_MODEL_CHECKPOINTS>\"\n# Define name for imported model\nimported_model_name = \"nova-micro-sagemaker-dpo-peft\"\n\nrequest_params = {\n    \"modelName\": imported_model_name,\n    \"modelSourceConfig\": {\"s3DataSource\": {\"s3Uri\": model_path}},\n    \"roleArn\": role,\n    \"clientRequestToken\": \"NovaRecipeSageMaker\",\n}\n# Create the model import \nresponse = bedrock.create_custom_model(**request_params)\n\n\nMonitor the model status. Wait until the model reaches the status ACTIVE or FAILED:\n\n\nfrom IPython.display import clear_output\nimport time\n\nwhile True:\n    response = bedrock.list_custom_models(sortBy='CreationTime',sortOrder='Descending')\n    model_summaries = response[\"modelSummaries\"]\n    status = \"\"\n    for model in model_summaries:\n        if model[\"modelName\"] == imported_model_name:\n            status = model[\"modelStatus\"].upper()\n            model_arn = model[\"modelArn\"]\n            print(f'{model[\"modelStatus\"].upper()} {model[\"modelArn\"]} ...')\n            if status in [\"ACTIVE\", \"FAILED\"]:\n                break\n    if status in [\"ACTIVE\", \"FAILED\"]:\n        break\n    clear_output(wait=True)\n    time.sleep(10)\n\nWhen the model import is complete, you will see it available through the AWS CLI:\n\naws bedrock list-custom-models\n{\n    \"modelSummaries\": [\n        {\n            \"modelArn\": \"arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1: 123456789101:custom-model/imported/abcd1234efgh\",\n            \"modelName\": \"nova-micro-sagemaker-dpo-peft\",\n            \"creationTime\": \"2025-07-16T12:52:39.348Z\",\n            \"baseModelArn\": \"arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/amazon.nova-micro-v1:0:128k\",\n            \"baseModelName\": \"\",\n            \"customizationType\": \"IMPORTED\",\n            \"ownerAccountId\": \"123456789101\",\n            \"modelStatus\": \"Active\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\nConfigure Amazon Bedrock Custom Model on-demand inference:\n\n\nrequest_params = {\n    \"clientRequestToken\": \"NovaRecipeSageMakerODI\",\n    \"modelDeploymentName\": f\"{imported_model_name}-odi\",\n    \"modelArn\": model_arn,\n}\n\nresponse = bedrock.create_custom_model_deployment(**request_params)\n\n\n\nMonitor the model deployment status.

      "description": "In recent years, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated AI adoption across various industries. However, to further augment LLMs’ capabilities and effectively use up-to-date information and domain-specific knowledge, integration with external data sources is essential. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has gained attention as an effective approach to address this challenge.\nRAG is a technique that searches relevant information from existing knowledge bases or documents based on user input, and incorporates this information into the LLM input to generate more accurate and contextually appropriate responses. This technique is being implemented across a wide range of applications, from using technical documentation in product development to answering FAQs in customer support, and even supporting decision-making systems based on the latest data.\nThe implementation of RAG brings significant value to both software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers and their users (tenants).\nSaaS providers can use a multi-tenant architecture that delivers services to multiple tenants from a single code base. As tenants use the service, their data accumulates while being protected by appropriate access control and data isolation. When implementing AI capabilities using LLMs in such environments, RAG makes it possible to use each tenant’s specific data to provide personalized AI services.\nLet’s consider a customer service call center SaaS as an example. Each tenant’s historical inquiry records, FAQs, and product manuals are accumulated as tenant-specific knowledge bases. By implementing a RAG system, the LLM can generate appropriate responses relevant to each tenant’s context by referencing these tenant-specific data sources. This enables highly accurate interactions that incorporate tenant-specific business knowledge—a level of customization that would not be possible with generic AI assistants. RAG serves as a crucial component for delivering personalized AI experiences in SaaS, contributing to service differentiation and value enhancement.\nHowever, using tenant-specific data through RAG presents technical challenges from security and privacy perspectives. The primary concern is implementing secure architecture that maintains data isolation between tenants and helps prevent unintended data leakage or cross-tenant access. In multi-tenant environments, the implementation of data security critically impacts the trustworthiness and competitive advantage of SaaS providers.\nAmazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases enables simpler RAG implementation. When using OpenSearch as a vector database, there are two options: Amazon OpenSearch Service or Amazon OpenSearch Serverless. Each option has different characteristics and permission models when building multi-tenant environments:\n\nAmazon OpenSearch Serverless: \n  \nMetadata filtering enables filtering of search results from the vector database by tenant (for more details, see Multi-tenant RAG with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases)\nIts permission model doesn’t segregate permissions for write operations such as data creations and updates\n \nAmazon OpenSearch Service: \n  \nFine-grained access control (FGAC)is available\nAccess is through a single AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role attached to the knowledge base, helping prevent the use of FGAC for permission segregation\n \n\nIn this post, we introduce tenant isolation patterns using a combination of JSON Web Token (JWT) and FGAC, along with tenant resource routing. If the aforementioned permission model limits you from achieving your FGAC objectives, you can use the solution in this post. The solution is implemented using OpenSearch Service as the vector database and AWS Lambda as the orchestration layer.\nIn the next section, we explore the specific implementation of tenant isolation using JWT and FGAC in OpenSearch Service, and how this enables a secure multi-tenant RAG environment.\nEffectiveness of JWT in multi-tenant data isolation in OpenSearch Service\nAs introduced in Storing Multi-Tenant SaaS Data with Amazon OpenSearch Service, OpenSearch Service offers multiple methods for managing multi-tenant data: domain-level isolation, index-level isolation, and document-level isolation.\nTo implement access permission segregation at the index and document levels, you can use FGAC, which is supported by the OpenSearch Security plugin.\nIn OpenSearch Service, you can achieve granular access control by mapping IAM identities to OpenSearch roles. This enables detailed permission settings in OpenSearch for each IAM identity. However, this approach presents significant scalability challenges. As the number of tenants increases, the required number of IAM users or roles also increases, potentially hitting the limit of AWS service quotas. Additionally, managing numerous IAM entities leads to operational complexity. Although dynamically generated IAM policies could overcome this challenge, each dynamically generated policy is attached to a single IAM role. A single IAM role can be mapped to a single OpenSearch role, but this would still require an IAM role and dynamic policy per tenant for appropriate isolation, which results in similar operational complexity managing numerous entities.\nThis post provides an alternative approach and focuses on the effectiveness of JWT, a self-contained token for implementing data isolation and access control in multi-tenant environments. Using JWT provides the following advantages:\n\nDynamic tenant identification – JWT payloads can include attribute information (tenant context) to identify tenants. This enables the system to dynamically identify tenants for each request and allows passing this context to subsequent resources and services.\nIntegration with FGAC in OpenSearch – FGAC can directly use attribute information in JWT for role mapping. This allows mapping of access permissions to specific indexes or documents based on information such as tenant IDs in the JWT.\n\nCombining JWT with FGAC provides secure, flexible, and scalable data isolation and access control in a multi-tenant RAG environment using OpenSearch Service. In the next section, we explore specific implementation details and technical considerations for applying this concept in actual systems.\nSolution overview\nIn RAG, data such as relevant documents used to augment LLM outputs are vectorized by embedding language models and indexed in a vector database. User questions in natural language are converted to vectors using the embedding model and searched in the vector database. The data retrieved through vector search is passed to the LLM as context to augment the output. The following diagram illustrates the solution architecture.\n\nThis solution uses OpenSearch Service as the vector data store for storing knowledge sources in RAG. The flow is as follows:\n\nRAG application users for each tenant are created as users in an Amazon Cognito user pool, receiving a JWT enriched with tenant ID information when logging in to the frontend. Each user’s tenant information is stored in Amazon DynamoDB and added to the JWT by a pre-token generation Lambda trigger during user authentication.\nWhen a user initiates a chat on the frontend, the user query is passed to Lambda using Amazon API Gateway along with the JWT.\nThe user query is vectorized in conjunction with text embedding models available in Amazon Bedrock.\nDomain and index information for retrieval is obtained from DynamoDB.\nVector search is performed on OpenSearch Service to retrieve information related to the query from the index.\nThe retrieved information is added to the prompt as context and passed to an LLM available in Amazon Bedrock to generate a response.\n\nThe key aspect of this solution is using JWT for tenant data isolation in OpenSearch Service and routing to each tenant’s data. It separates access permissions for each dataset using FGAC available in OpenSearch Service and uses tenant ID information added to the JWT for mapping application users to separated permission sets. The solution provides three different patterns for data isolation granularity to meet customer requirements. Routing is also enabled by defining the mapping between tenant ID information from JWT and data location (domain, index) in DynamoDB.\nWhen users add documents, files are uploaded to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and metadata is written to DynamoDB management table. When storing data in OpenSearch Service, the text embedding model (Amazon Bedrock) is called by the ingest pipeline for vectorization. For document creation, update, and deletion, JWT is attached to requests, allowing tenant identification.\nThis solution is implemented using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK). For details, refer to the GitHub repository. The instructions to deploy the solution are included in the README file in the repository.\nPrerequisites\nTo try this solution, you must have the following prerequisites:\n\nAn AWS account.\nIAM access permissions necessary for running the AWS CDK.\nA frontend execution environment: node.js and npm installation is required.\nThe AWS CDK must be configured. For details, refer to Tutorial: Create your first AWS CDK app.\nAccess to the models used in Amazon Bedrock must be configured. This solution uses Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 and Amazon Titan Text Embedding V2. For details, refer to Add or remove access to Amazon Bedrock foundation models.\n\nIn addition to the resources shown in the architecture diagram, the following resources and configurations are created as AWS CloudFormation custom resources through AWS CDK deployment:\n\nAmazon Cognito user pool: \n  \nUsers for tenant-a, tenant-b, tenant-c, and tenant-d\n \nDynamoDB table: \n  \nMapping between users and tenants\nMapping between tenants and OpenSearch connection destinations and indexes\n \nOpenSearch Service domain: \n  \nJWT authentication settings\nIngest pipeline for vector embedding\nFGAC roles and role mappings for each tenant\nk-NN index\n \n\nUser authentication and JWT generation with Amazon Cognito\nThis solution uses an Amazon Cognito user pool for RAG application user authentication. Amazon Cognito user pools issue JWT during authentication. Because FGAC in OpenSearch Service supports JWT authentication, access from users authenticated by the Amazon Cognito user pool can be permitted by registering public keys issued by the user pool with the OpenSearch Service domain. Additionally, authorization is performed using attributes that can be added to the JWT payload for tenant data access permission segregation with FGAC, which we discuss in the following sections. To achieve this, a pre-token generation Lambda trigger is configured in the Amazon Cognito user pool to retrieve tenant ID information for each user stored in DynamoDB and add it to the token. The obtained JWT is retained by the frontend and used for requests to the backend. DynamoDB stores the mapping between user ID (sub) and tenant ID as follows:\n\n{\n  \"pk\": {\n    \"S\": \"membership#<Cognito user ID (sub)>\"\n  },\n  \"sk\": {\n    \"S\": \"tenant#tenant-a\"\n  }\n}\n\nAlthough multiple patterns exist for implementing multi-tenant authentication with Amazon Cognito, this implementation uses a single user pool with user-tenant mappings in DynamoDB. Additional considerations are necessary for production environments; refer to Multi-tenant application best practices.\nRequest routing to tenant data using JWT\nIn multi-tenant architectures where resources are separated by tenant, requests from tenants are essential to route to appropriate resources. To learn more about tenant routing strategies, see Tenant routing strategies for SaaS applications on AWS. This solution uses an approach similar to data-driven routing as described in the post for routing to OpenSearch Service.\nThe DynamoDB table stores mapping information for tenant IDs, target OpenSearch Service domains, and indexes as follows:\n\n{\n  \"pk\": {\n    \"S\": \"tenant#tenant-a\"\n  },\n  \"sk\": {\n    \"S\": \"os_config\"\n  },\n  \"os_host\": {\n    \"S\": \"<Amazon OpenSearch Service domain endpoint>\"\n  },\n  \"os_index\": {\n    \"S\": \"tenant-a-index\"\n  },\n  \"rag_role\": {\n    \"S\": \"tenant-a_role\"\n  }\n}\n\nThe JWT is obtained from the Authorization header in HTTP requests sent from the frontend to the Lambda function through API Gateway. The routing destination is determined by retrieving the routing information using the tenant ID obtained from parsing the JWT. Additionally, the JWT is used as authentication information for requests to OpenSearch, as described in the following section.\nMulti-tenant isolation of data locations and access permissions in OpenSearch Service\nMulti-tenant data isolation strategies in OpenSearch Service include three types of isolation patterns: domain-level, index-level, and document-level isolation, and hybrid models combining these. This solution uses FGAC for access permission control to tenant data, creating dedicated roles for each tenant.\nMapping between tenant users and FGAC tenant roles is implemented through backend roles. In JWT authentication available in OpenSearch Service, the attribute within the JWT payload to be linked with backend roles can be specified as the Roles key. The following screenshot shows this domain config.\n\nThe JWT payload includes a tenant_id attribute as follows:\"tenant_id\": \"tenant-a\" Tenant users and FGAC roles are linked by setting this attribute as the roles key in OpenSearch JWT authentication and mapping roles as follows:\n\n{\n  \"tenant-a_role\": {\n    \"backend_roles\": [\n      \"tenant-a\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nThe following screenshot shows an example of tenant role mapping in FGAC in OpenSearch Dashboards.\n\nThe sample in this solution provides four tenants—tenant-a, tenant-b, tenant-c, and tenant-d—so you can try all three isolation methods. The following diagram illustrates this architecture.\n\nEach role is assigned permissions to access only the corresponding tenant data. In this section, we introduce how to implement each of the three isolation methods using JWT and FGAC:\n\nDomain-level isolation – Assign individual OpenSearch Service domains to each tenant. Because domains are dedicated to each tenant in this pattern of isolation, there’s no need for data isolation within the domain. Therefore, FGAC roles grant access permissions across the indexes. The following code is part of index_permissions in the FGAC role definition that grants access to the indexes:\n\n\n\"index_permissions\": [\n    {\n    \"index_patterns\": [\n        \"*\"\n    ],\n\n\nIndex-level isolation – Multiple tenants share an OpenSearch Service domain, with individual indexes assigned to each tenant. Each tenant should only be able to access their own index, so index_permissions in the FGAC role is configured as follows (example for tenant-b):\n\n\n\"index_permissions\": [\n    {\n    \"index_patterns\": [\n        \"tenant-b-index*\"\n    ]\n\n\nDocument-level isolation – Multiple tenants share OpenSearch Service domains and indexes, using FGAC document-level security for access permission segregation of tenant data within the index. Each index includes a field to store tenant ID information, and document-level security queries are set for that field. The following code is part of index_permissions for an FGAC role that allows tenant-c to access only its own data in a configuration where tenant-c and tenant-d share an index:\n\n\n\"index_permissions\": [\n    {\n    \"index_patterns\": [\n        \"tenant-cd-shared-index*\"\n    ],\n    \"dls\": \"\"\"{\"bool\": {\"must\": {\"match\": {\"tenant_id\": \"tenant-c\"}}}}\"\"\",\n\nThe following screenshot shows an example of index permission for document-level isolation in the FGAC role.\n\nConsiderations\nThe implementation in this post uses a model where DynamoDB tables and S3 buckets are shared between tenants. For production use, consider partitioning models as introduced in Partitioning Pooled Multi-Tenant SaaS Data with Amazon DynamoDB and Partitioning and Isolating Multi-Tenant SaaS Data with Amazon S3) and determine the optimal model based on your requirements.\nAdditionally, you can use dynamic generation of IAM policies as an additional layer to restrict access permissions to each resource.\nClean up\nTo avoid unexpected charges, we recommend deleting resources when they are no longer needed. Because the resources are created with the AWS CDK, run the cdk destroy command to delete them. This operation will also delete the documents uploaded to Amazon S3.\nConclusions\nIn this post, we introduced a solution that uses OpenSearch Service as a vector data store in multi-tenant RAG, achieving data isolation and routing using JWT and FGAC.\nThis solution uses a combination of JWT and FGAC to implement strict tenant data access isolation and routing, necessitating the use of OpenSearch Service. The RAG application is implemented independently, because at the time of writing, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases can’t use JWT-based access to OpenSearch Service.Multi-tenant RAG usage is important for SaaS companies, and strategies vary depending on requirements such as data isolation strictness, ease of management, and cost. This solution implements multiple isolation models, so you can choose based on your requirements.For other solutions and information regarding multi-tenant RAG implementation, refer to the following resources:\n\nMulti-tenant RAG with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases\nBuild a multi-tenant generative AI environment for your enterprise on AWS\nSelf-managed multi-tenant vector search with Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL\nMulti-tenant vector search with Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL and Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases\n\n\n\nAbout the authors\nKazuki Nagasawa is a Cloud Support Engineer at Amazon Web Services.

      "link": "https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/enhance-generative-ai-solutions-using-amazon-q-index-with-model-context-protocol-part-1/",
      "description": "Today’s enterprises increasingly rely on AI-driven applications to enhance decision-making, streamline workflows, and deliver improved customer experiences. Achieving these outcomes demands secure, timely, and accurate access to authoritative data—especially when such data resides across diverse repositories and applications within strict enterprise security boundaries.\nInteroperable technologies powered by open standards like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) are rapidly emerging. MCP simplifies the process for connecting AI applications and agents to third-party tools and data sources, enabling lightweight, real-time interactions and structured operations with minimal engineering effort. Independent software vendor (ISV) applications can securely query their customers’ Amazon Q index using cross-account access, retrieving only the content each user is authorized to see, such as documents, tickets, chat threads, CRM records, and more. Amazon Q connectors regularly sync and index this data to keep it fresh. Amazon Q index’s hybrid semantic-plus-keyword ranking then helps ISVs deliver context-rich answers without building their own search stack.\nAs large language models (LLMs) and generative AI become integral to enterprise operations, clearly defined integration patterns between MCP and Amazon Q index become increasingly valuable. ISVs exploring the MCP landscape to automate structured actions such as creating tickets or processing approvals can seamlessly integrate Amazon Q index to retrieve authoritative data. Authoritative data enables accurate and confident execution of these actions, reducing risk, minimizing costly errors, and strengthening trust in AI-driven outcomes. For example, a customer support assistant using MCP can automatically open an urgent ticket and instantly retrieve a relevant troubleshooting guide from Amazon Q index to accelerate incident resolution. AWS continues to invest in tighter interoperability between MCP and Amazon Q index within enterprise AI architectures. In this post, we explore best practices and integration patterns for combining Amazon Q index and MCP, enabling enterprises to build secure, scalable, and actionable AI search-and-retrieval architectures.\nKey components overview\nLet’s break down the two key components referenced throughout the post: MCP and Amazon Q index.\nMCP is an open JSON-RPC standard that lets LLMs invoke external tools and data using structured schemas. Each tool schema defines actions, inputs, outputs, versioning, and access scope, giving developers a consistent interface across enterprise systems. To learn more, refer to the MCP User Guide.\nAmazon Q index is a fully managed, cross-account, semantic search service within Amazon Q Business that helps ISVs augment their generative AI chat assistants with customer data. It combines semantic and keyword-based ranking to securely retrieve relevant, user-authorized content through the SearchRelevantContent API, so ISVs can enrich their applications with precise, customer-specific context.\nCompanies like Zoom and PagerDuty use Amazon Q index to enhance their AI-driven search experiences. For example, Zoom uses Amazon Q index to help users securely and contextually access their enterprise knowledge directly within the Zoom AI Companion interface, enhancing real-time productivity during meetings. Similarly, PagerDuty Advance uses Amazon Q index to surface operational runbooks and incident context during live alerts, dramatically improving incident resolution workflows.\nEnhancing MCP workflows with Amazon Q index\nTo fully capitalize on MCP-driven structured actions, modern AI assistants require enterprise-grade knowledge retrieval capabilities—fast responses, precise relevance ranking, and robust permission enforcement. Effective actions depend on timely, accurate, and secure access to authoritative enterprise data. Amazon Q index directly meets these advanced search needs, providing a secure, scalable retrieval layer that enhances and accelerates MCP workflows:\n\nSecure ISV integration with the data accessor pattern – ISVs can seamlessly integrate customer enterprise data into their applications using Amazon Q index, providing enriched, generative AI-driven experiences without needing to store or directly index customer data sources. This follows the data accessor pattern, where the ISV acts as a trusted accessor with scoped permissions to securely query the customer’s Amazon Q index and retrieve only authorized results. Companies like Asana, Zoom, and PagerDuty already use this integration approach to enhance their applications securely and efficiently.\nHighly accurate and managed relevance – Amazon Q index automatically executes both keyword-based (sparse) matching and vector-based (dense/semantic) similarity searches with every SearchRelevantContent API call. Semantic search uses embeddings to understand the contextual meaning of content rather than relying solely on keyword matches, significantly improving accuracy and user satisfaction. Combining semantic and keyword-based search (a hybrid approach) facilitates maximum retrieval accuracy and relevant results.\nBuilt-in connectors and automatic indexing – Amazon Q index offers managed, built-in connectors for widely used enterprise applications such as SharePoint, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and Confluence. These connectors automatically crawl and index enterprise content on a scheduled basis, significantly reducing manual setup and maintenance while keeping data fresh and searchable.\nFully managed document-level security – During indexing, Amazon Q index captures source-system ACLs, automatically enforcing these permissions with every query. Users can only search data they’ve been previously granted permission to access. Data is encrypted using customer managed AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys, with access logged using AWS CloudTrail for auditability.\n\nBy managing indexing, ranking, and security, Amazon Q index helps organizations deploy sophisticated enterprise search quickly—typically within weeks. To learn more, see Amazon Q index for independent software vendors (ISVs).\nAmazon Q index integration patterns\nNow that we’ve explored how Amazon Q index enhances MCP workflows, let’s look at two practical integration patterns enterprises and ISVs commonly adopt to combine these complementary technologies. ISVs and enterprises can access a unified, identity-aware semantic search API called SearchRelevantContent that securely accesses connected enterprise data sources (to learn more, see New capabilities from Amazon Q Business enable ISVs to enhance generative AI experiences).\nWhen planning their integration strategy, organizations typically evaluate factors such as implementation speed, operational complexity, security requirements, and existing MCP commitments. The following patterns highlight common integration approaches, outlining the associated trade-offs and benefits of each scenario:\n\nPattern 1 – Amazon Q index integration with a data accessor (no MCP layer)\nPattern 2 – Integrating Amazon Q index using MCP tools\n\nPattern 1: Amazon Q index integration with a data accessor (no MCP layer)\nCustomers might opt for simplicity and speed by directly using Amazon Q index without involving MCP. The following diagram illustrates this straightforward and fully managed approach.\n\nThis pattern is best suited when your primary requirement is direct, performant search through a fully managed API, and you don’t currently need the orchestration and standardization provided by MCP integration. To learn more, refer to Q index workshop and the following GitHub repo.\nThe pattern includes the following components:\n\nThe SearchRelevantContent API is called using a secure, scoped AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provided by the ISV. There’s no MCP layer to build, credentials to manage, or infrastructure to run—integration is handled entirely through an AWS managed API.\nAfter the ISV-provided IAM role is approved by the enterprise and AWS, AWS manages the backend—including connectors, incremental content crawling, vector and keyword indexing, intelligent ranking, and secure, document-level access control within Amazon Q index.\nEnterprise permissions are scoped to a single IAM role that the enterprise explicitly approves. Indexed data is encrypted using customer managed KMS keys, with access tightly controlled and fully audited through CloudTrail.\n\nPattern 2: Integrating Amazon Q index using MCP tools\nBy adding Amazon Q index retrieval using MCP, ISVs maintain a consistent MCP-based architecture across actions and retrieval, as illustrated in the following diagram.\n\nThis pattern provides a uniform MCP interface for ISVs who already use MCP tools for multiple structured actions. To learn more, refer to the following GitHub repo.\nThe pattern includes the following components:\n\nThe SearchRelevantContent API is wrapped as a tool inside an existing MCP system, adding custom logging or throttling.\nEnd-users interact only with the ISV’s application. Behind the scenes, the ISV’s MCP server queries Amazon Q index with the approved data accessor role.\nISVs must protect tenant isolation, encrypt transit traffic, and log every call. The enterprise offloads patching and intrusion detection to the ISV but retains document‑level ACL enforcement using Amazon Q index.\n\nConsiderations for choosing your integration pattern\nWhen choosing your integration pattern, consider these key questions:\n\nIs rapid deployment with minimal operational overhead your top priority? Choose Pattern 1 (direct SearchRelevantContent using a data accessor) if you want the fastest route to production-grade, managed retrieval. AWS fully manages indexing, ranking, and document-level permissions, requiring no additional infrastructure from your organization.\nAre you an ISV aiming to deliver a consistent MCP interface for orchestrating retrieval alongside other tools? Pattern 2 (ISV-hosted MCP) is typically the best choice if you’re an ISV providing a standardized MCP experience to multiple enterprise customers. AWS continues managing indexing, ranking, and permissions, and your organization maintains and operates the MCP server infrastructure for greater orchestration flexibility.\n\nYour ideal integration path ultimately depends on balancing rapid deployment, orchestration flexibility, and compliance requirements specific to your organization.\nDetermining when MCP-only retrieval is sufficient\nAlthough integrating MCP with Amazon Q index effectively addresses most scenarios for enriching ISV application responses with enterprise data, certain clearly defined use cases benefit from a simpler, MCP-only approach. MCP’s schema-driven architecture is ideal for straightforward, keyword-based queries involving a single or limited set of repositories, such as checking ticket statuses. It also excels when real-time data retrieval is essential, including inventory monitoring, streaming log analysis, or accessing real-time metrics, where pre-indexing content offers little value. Additionally, some vendors offer ready-made, MCP-compatible endpoints, such as Atlassian’s interface for Confluence, so enterprises can quickly plug into these MCP servers, access real-time data without indexing, and use secure, feature-rich integrations that are supported and maintained by the vendor.In these scenarios, MCP-only retrieval serves as an efficient, lightweight alternative to fully indexed search solutions like Amazon Q index—especially when the need for orchestration, ranking, and semantic understanding is minimal.\nConclusion\nIn this post, we explored how ISVs can integrate Amazon Q index into the MCP landscape for enterprise data retrieval, complementing other structured-action tools. Authoritative data is critical for structured actions because it enables accurate decision-making, reduces operational risk, minimizes costly errors, and strengthens trust in AI-driven solutions. By combining MCP’s ability to automate real-time actions with the powerful data retrieval capabilities of Amazon Q index, enterprises and ISVs can rapidly address critical business problems using generative AI. This integrated approach reduces complexity, streamlines operations, and helps organizations meet stringent governance, compliance, and performance standards without the need to build custom indexing and retrieval infrastructure.

      "description": "This Week in Turing Post:Wednesday – New episode in the AI 101 series! About GLM5, Kimi K2, DeepSeek and Qwen – don’t miss this oneFriday – We start new exciting and much needed series about AI LiteracyTopic number one: What Does It Mean to Win in the AI Race?The race is on. According to the White House’s newly unveiled AI Action Plan, America is locked in a sprint for \"unquestioned and unchallenged global technological dominance.\" The plan, brimming with the rhetoric of competition, promises an era of unprecedented prosperity – \"an industrial revolution, an information revolution, and a renaissance – all at once.\" Washington’s strategy is clear: unleash the private sector, fast-track infrastructure, and secure the supply chain.An excellent suggestion from the AI Action PlanThis focus on a singular \"race\" is compelling, but it dangerously simplifies the messy, multi-layered reality of how AI is actually unfolding. While governments are drafting grand strategies, the technology itself is proliferating on vastly different fronts. At one end, AI is becoming a quiet, personal utility. Projects like Google's Opal, announced last week, aim to make the technology tangible, a helpful tool embedded in daily routines. Simultaneously, the geopolitical landscape is being reshaped not just by policy but by brute-force economics, as inexpensive but powerful Chinese AI models flood the global market, setting new baselines for cost and accessibility that American strategy cannot ignore.The reality of AI, therefore, isn’t a single, unified movement. It is a complex, simultaneous unfolding – personal, geopolitical, and political – happening in our homes, on global servers, and in the halls of power. And it is this complex reality that makes the government’s narrow focus on \"winning\" a potential strategic blunder. The plan – though excellent on many levels – is still a play of catching up. It overlooks the fact that the finish line is not a simple victory podium, but a radically new economic and social landscape we are ill-prepared to navigate. As a recent analysis in The Economist speculates, the arrival of human-level AI could trigger an explosion of economic growth exceeding 20% annually. It. Is. A. Phase. Change. When AI can automate discovery itself, wealth could accumulate at a speed that makes the Industrial Revolution look quaint. But this boom comes with a tsunami of disruption. The same models projecting hypergrowth also predict gut-wrenching inequality, with the value of most human cognitive labor plummeting toward the cost of computation. We could face a world of bizarre \"cost disease,\" where AI-produced goods are nearly free, but human-dependent services become astronomically expensive.The Action Plan acknowledges the need to \"Empower American Workers,\" but its solutions – retraining and job creation – feel tragically inadequate for the scale of this change. It is a 20th-century solution for a 22nd-century problem. It focuses on getting people new jobs in the supercharged economy but fails to ask a more fundamental question: What does a good life look like in that economy?A recent study in Nature Human Behaviour, though seemingly unrelated, offers a glimpse of a different way forward. Researchers found that a four-day workweek significantly improved worker well-being, reducing burnout and improving health. The study is not a panacea, but it represents a crucial paradigm shift: a conscious redesign of work to prioritize human flourishing over raw output. This is the conversation missing in Washington. How can AI give us not just more products, but more time? Not just automated labor, but less burnout?The role of government in the era of superintelligence must be twofold. Yes, it must foster innovation. But its more critical task is to be the architect of a new social contract that addresses the multi-layered reality of AI. This means grappling with the core challenges of inequality, purpose, and well-being in a world where the very economic value of human labor is being questioned.Winning a race is a seductive, simple goal. But the \"race\" is a red herring. True victory lies not in building the most powerful AI, but in building the most prosperous, equitable, and humane society alongside it. If we only focus on the sprint, we may find ourselves at a finish line in a world we no longer recognize.Next Monday, I’ll share an idea of what a good life might look like in the AI economy. It was an interesting thought experiment.Our 3 WOWs and 1 Promise: Last week was truly amazing, a lot of things to be optimistic about: watch to learn about an AI with virtually limitless visual recall; Google’s awesome model that helps decoding ancient empires; Neuralink’s actual patients.

      "description": "Today’s paper: Voice-based AI Agents: Filling the Economic Gaps in Digital Health Delivery. Wen et al. 22 July 2025. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16229Healthcare systems worldwide face growing challenges in allocating limited medical resources to meet increasing demand. Traditional healthcare delivery models, centered on episodic patient-provider interactions, often result in significant gaps in continuous care, particularly in preventive health monitoring and chronic disease management. The integration of voice-based AI agents in healthcare presents a transformative opportunity to bridge economic and accessibility gaps in digital health delivery. Today’s paper explores the role of large language model (LLM)-powered voice assistants in enhancing preventive care and continuous patient monitoring, particularly in underserved populations.Thanks for reading AI Scientist! This post is public so feel free to share it.ShareLet’s get started first with the economics. The figure below demonstrates how AI can efficiently fill care gaps, particularly during lower-severity periods when human medical resources would be economically unjustifiable yet monitoring remains beneficial. This model aligns with the concept of risk stratification in healthcare economics, where resources are allocated according to patient risk levels and expected benefits. It allows healthcare systems to maximize the utility of scarce physician and nursing resources by focusing them on high-severity cases while deploying AI for continuous monitoring of patients with less severe conditions.LLM-driven voice bot technology offers a compelling solution to replace traditional interactive voice response (IVR) systems, which are often plagued by frustrating menu-driven interactions (“press 1 for X, press 2 for Y”) that can drive users to bypass the system completely. These legacy systems are due to limitations in earlier natural language processing, which could only handle basic speech recognition and simple intent mapping. Engineers were forced to create rigid menu structures that corresponded to specific business logic, resulting in rule-based systems with minimal awareness and personalization of the context. As organizations expanded services, these menu structures became increasingly complex and unintuitive. Users faced multiple layers of options, making voice interfaces less appealing than web or text alternatives.LLM-driven systems transform this experience by enabling natural language interactions. Patients can simply state their needs, and AI determines the appropriate service, asks relevant follow-up questions, and provides personalized assistance, eliminating the need for predefined menu navigation. This approach improves the user experience while improving accessibility for those with limited technological knowledge or physical limitations.The lack of scalable models for preventive care often leads to delayed diagnoses, costly emergency treatments, and preventable hospitalizations—a phenomenon commonly referred to as the “prevention paradox.” AI-powered voice agents present a promising alternative by offering continuous patient engagement at significantly lower costs compared to traditional human-led care.Several economic advantages showcase the potential of AI in healthcare delivery:Economies of scale: Once deployed, AI voice assistants can support millions of users with little additional cost, as fixed infrastructure expenses are distributed across a broad patient base.Round-the-clock availability: These systems operate 24/7, removing the time constraints associated with human healthcare providers and reducing the opportunity costs of limited care access.Consistency in service: AI systems deliver standardized patient interactions, avoiding the variability caused by human fatigue, time pressure, or inconsistent workflows.Proactive data collection: By continuously monitoring patient symptoms, AI agents facilitate early intervention and generate structured data that can be used by healthcare professionals to improve outcomes and reduce information gaps.Rapid knowledge updates: New medical guidelines, regulatory recommendations, and clinical best practices can be integrated quickly into AI systems via techniques such as fine-tuning or retrieval-augmented generation, ensuring that patients receive the most up-to-date information without the delays or costs associated with retraining human staff.Agent PULSE, proposed by the authors, is a telephonic AI system designed to conduct medical surveys and monitor patient conditions through natural conversation. The core of the system is a dialogue management engine powered by prompt-tuned LLMs capable of understanding patient responses, asking follow-up questions, providing guidance and education, and escalating to human healthcare personnel when necessary.It consists of several key components working in concert to deliver intelligent healthcare interactions: Voice Interface: The system is accessible through standard telephone lines, ensuring broad usability across different demographics, particularly beneficial for patients who may face literacy, technological, or financial barriers to smartphone or computer-based interfaces. Thanks to LLM integration, the voice interface supports multiple languages, providing access to diverse patient populations regardless of their native language:The AI engine is built on IBM’s watsonx platform, which serves as the system’s core intelligence layer. This platform incorporates multiple advanced components, including watsonx.ai—a large language model (LLM) inference service that supports integration with various LLM providers and allows for customized configurations and fine-tuning. At the heart of its reasoning capabilities is SOLOMON, IBM’s proprietary multi-agent framework designed to manage conversations intelligently and analyze unstructured patient dialogue. SOLOMON automatically extracts structured data from natural language exchanges, transforming free-form conversations into standardized questionnaire responses that can be easily reviewed by care teams. Additionally, the system leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to combine these structured inputs with relevant medical knowledge, enabling informed and context-aware responses.The physician dashboard provides a comprehensive interface that enables healthcare providers to efficiently manage and customize patient interactions. Through this platform, providers can organize calling schedules for large patient cohorts, optimizing resource allocation and ensuring timely follow-ups. The dashboard also allows for the customization of survey parameters such as language preferences, questionnaire content, time zones, and other logistical details to better accommodate individual patient needs. Providers can review call results and survey summaries automatically generated by the SOLOMON system, using these insights to inform care interventions. Additionally, the dashboard supports longitudinal tracking of patient progress through automated trend analysis based on repeated assessments over time.The authors also describe a pilot study on patient engagement to demonstrate the utility of the approach. Prior to implementing Agent PULSE, Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) faced significant challenges in monitoring patients’ conditions between clinical visits. Initially, MSM employed two nurses to conduct individual follow-up calls with patients. However, this approach proved costly and unsustainable, as the nurses quickly experienced burnout due to the high volume of calls. To improve scalability, MSM transitioned to a group-based model using Zoom meetings, where multiple patients simultaneously shared their disease progress with the care team. While this approach allowed providers to reach more patients, it required individuals to discuss personal symptoms and health concerns in the presence of other patients, raising privacy concerns and potentially limiting disclosure of sensitive information. These challenges highlight the economic gap in healthcare delivery discussed earlier in this paper—where human-led monitoring becomes unsustainable at scale. The cultural and linguistic barriers faced by human providers further exacerbate these inefficiencies, as healthcare systems cannot economically justify hiring culturally matched staff for every patient subgroup. Voice-based AI agents like PULSE represent a potential solution by offering continuous, cost-effective patient monitoring while reducing the burden on healthcare providers and transcending cultural barriers through consistent, nonjudgmental interactions.The authors’ findings revealed encouraging patient receptivity to AI-driven healthcare interactions. As shown in Figure 3 above, 37% of patients preferred the AI chatbot over other methods, while 24% favored the Zoom group approach primarily for its social interaction component. Notably, 18% of patients recognized value in both approaches, suggesting they serve complementary purposes, while 15% expressed no strong preference between the methods. Only 3% specifically preferred human interaction, and another 3% disliked both approaches.Analysis of response completeness (Figure 4 below) revealed significant variations across question categories. Questions about daily activities and daily life impact achieved the highest completion rates (94.4%), likely because these topics directly relate to patients’ symptoms and well-being—areas where patients have strong motivation to provide comprehensive information. In contrast, questions about research solutions, environmental triggers, and treatment feedback showed substantially lower completion rates, particularly those appearing later in the survey.The authors’ experience with Agent PULSE provides empirical support for the economic model presented earlier. The pilot study clearly demonstrated that voice-based AI agents can effectively fill gaps in care delivery, particularly for routine monitoring between clinical visits. The high acceptance rate among patients (70% expressing comfort with AI interaction) suggests that such systems can achieve the necessary user engagement to deliver economic benefits in real-world settings. The authors also identify some technical challenges, followed by a roadmap. One of the most important factors affecting patient experience with voice AI systems is response time and consistency. When AI systems take too long to respond or fail to remember previous parts of a conversation, patients may become frustrated and disengage. The authors’ work identified significant opportunities to improve how AI systems manage conversations through better memory management techniques. These improvements could reduce AI response times by 2-3 times while maintaining natural flow in conversations. For patients, this means fewer awkward pauses and a more natural interaction similar to speaking with a human healthcare provider.Also, to maximize effectiveness, voice-based AI health agents must adapt to individual patient communication styles, preferences, health literacy levels, and cultural contexts. Current methods predominantly employ static prompts that don’t fully exploit LLM adaptive capabilities. A comprehensive personalization framework should include: dynamic patient profiles that evolve based on interaction history; language complexity adjustment matching health literacy levels; cultural competence in conversational strategies; and personalized timing and frequency of outreach based on patient preferences and response patterns. These capabilities would significantly improve engagement, trust, and sustained patient participation while ensuring comprehension and adherence across diverse populations.In closing the musing, it’s important to end with a note on the broader ethical considerations, such as ensuring AI complements human connection, seamless escalation to human providers, and vigilant monitoring for algorithmic bias, especially given historical disparities, are critical. Voice-based AI offers an inclusive path to democratizing healthcare, transforming care delivery by extending provider reach to underserved populations and addressing economic constraints. Future research should target longitudinal outcomes, remote monitoring integration, and condition-specific applications. Most importantly, as the authors themselves note, success requires multidisciplinary collaboration: clinicians contributing expertise, technologists developing robust systems, policymakers establishing supportive frameworks, and patients providing essential feedback. This collaborative approach will maximize voice-based AI’s potential as an entry point for sustainable healthcare delivery.Thanks for reading AI Scientist!

      "link": "https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/the-bitter-lesson-versus-the-garbage",
      "description": "One of my favorite academic papers about organizations is by Ruthanne Huising, and it tells the story of teams that were assigned to create process maps of their company, tracing what the organization actually did, from raw materials to finished goods. As they created this map, they realized how much of the work seemed strange and unplanned. They discovered entire processes that produced outputs nobody used, weird semi-official pathways to getting things done, and repeated duplication of efforts. Many of the employees working on the map, once rising stars of the company, became disillusioned.The Process MapI’ll let Prof. Huising explain what happened next: “Some held out hope that one or two people at the top knew of these design and operation issues; however, they were often disabused of this optimism. For example, a manager walked the CEO through the map, presenting him with a view he had never seen before and illustrating for him the lack of design and the disconnect between strategy and operations. The CEO, after being walked through the map, sat down, put his head on the table, and said, \"This is even more fucked up than I imagined.\" The CEO revealed that not only was the operation of his organization out of his control but that his grasp on it was imaginary.”For many people, this may not be a surprise. One thing you learn studying (or working in) organizations is that they are all actually a bit of a mess. In fact, one classic organizational theory is actually called the Garbage Can Model. This views organizations as chaotic \"garbage cans\" where problems, solutions, and decision-makers are dumped in together, and decisions often happen when these elements collide randomly, rather than through a fully rational process. Of course, it is easy to take this view too far - organizations do have structures, decision-makers, and processes that actually matter. It is just that these structures often evolved and were negotiated among people, rather than being carefully designed and well-recorded.The Garbage Can represents a world where unwritten rules, bespoke knowledge, and complex and undocumented processes are critical. It is this situation that makes AI adoption in organizations difficult, because even though 43% of American workers have used AI at work, they are mostly doing it in informal ways, solving their own work problems. Scaling AI across the enterprise is hard because traditional automation requires clear rules and defined processes; the very things Garbage Can organizations lack. To address the more general issues of AI and work requires careful building of AI-powered systems for specific use cases, mapping out the real processes and making tools to solve the issues that are discovered. This is a hard, slow process that suggests enterprise AI adoption will take time. At least, that's how it looks if we assume AI needs to understand our organizations the way we do. But AI researchers have learned something important about these sorts of assumptions.The Bitter LessonComputer scientist Richard Sutton introduced the concept of the Bitter Lesson in an influential 2019 essay where he pointed out a pattern in AI research. Time and again, AI researchers trying to solve a difficult problem, like beating humans in chess, turned to elegant solutions, studying opening moves, positional evaluations, tactical patterns, and endgame databases. Programmers encoded centuries of chess wisdom in hand-crafted software: control the center, develop pieces early, king safety matters, passed pawns are valuable, and so on. Deep Blue, the first chess computer to beat the world’s best human, used some chess knowledge, but combined that with the brute force of being able to search 200 million positions a second. In 2017, Google released AlphaZero, which could beat humans not just in chess but also in shogi and go, and it did it with no prior knowledge of these games at all. Instead, the AI model trained against itself, playing the games until it learned them. All of the elegant knowledge of chess was irrelevant, pure brute force computing combined with generalized approaches to machine learning, was enough to beat them. And that is the Bitter Lesson — encoding human understanding into an AI tends to be worse than just letting the AI figure out how to solve the problem, and adding enough computing power until it can do it better than any human.Why two versions of this graph? And why are they slightly different? Answers in a bit!The lesson is bitter because it means that our human understanding of problems built from a lifetime of experience is not that important in solving a problem with AI. Decades of researchers' careful work encoding human expertise was ultimately less effective than just throwing more computation at the problem. We are soon going to see whether the Bitter Lesson applies widely to the world of work.AgentsWhile individuals can get a lot of benefits out of using chatbots themselves, a lot of excitement about how to use AI in organizations focuses on agents, a fuzzy term that I define as AI systems capable of taking autonomous action to accomplish a goal. As opposed to guiding a chatbot with prompting, you delegate a task to an agent, and it accomplishes it. However, previous AI systems have not been good enough to handle the full range of organizational needs, there is just too much messiness in the real world. This is why when we created our first AI-powered teaching games a year ago, we had to carefully design each step in the agentic system to handle narrow tasks. And though AI ability to work autonomously is increasing very rapidly, they are still far from human-level on most complicated jobs and are easily led astray on complex tasks.This is with an 80% success thresholdAs an example of the state-of-the art in agentic systems, consider Manus, which uses Claude and a series of clever approaches to make AI agents that can get real work done. The Manus team has shared a lot of tips for building agents, involving some interesting bits of engineering and very elaborate prompt design. When writing this post, I asked Manus: “i need an attractive graph that compares the ELO of the best grandmaster and the ELO of the worlds best chess computer from the first modern chess computer through 2025.” And the system got to work. First, Manus always creates a to-do list, then it gathered data and wrote a number of files and, after some minor adjustments I asked for, finally came up with the graph you can see on the left side above (the one without the box around the graph).Why did it do these things in this order? Because Manus was built by hand, carefully crafted to be the best general purpose agent available. There are hundreds of lines of bespoke text in its system prompts, including detailed instructions about how to build a to-do list. It incorporates hard-won knowledge on how to make agents work with today’s AI systems.Do you see the potential problem? “Carefully crafted,” “bespoke,” “incorporates hard-won knowledge” — exactly the kind of work the Bitter Lesson tells us to avoid because it will eventually be made irrelevant by more general-purpose techniques.It turns out there is now evidence that this may be possible with the recent release of ChatGPT agent (an uninspiring name, but at least it is clear, a big step forward for OpenAI!). ChatGPT agent represents a fundamental shift. It is not trained on the process of doing work; instead, OpenAI used reinforcement learning to train their AI on the actual final outcomes. For example. they may not teach it how to create an Excel file the way a human would, they would simply rate the quality of the Excel files it creates until it learns to make a good one, using whatever methods the AI develops. To illustrate how reinforcement learning and careful crafting lead to similar outcomes, I gave the exact same chess prompt to ChatGPT agent and got the graph on the right above. But this time there was no to-do list, no script to follow, instead the agent charted whatever mysterious course was required to get me the best output it could, according to its training. You can see an excerpt of that below:But you might notice a few differences between the two charts, besides their appearance. For example, each has different ratings for Deep Blue’s performance because the ELO for Deep Blue was never officially measured. The rating from Manus was based off a basic search, we found a speculative Reddit discussion, while the ChatGPT agent, trained with the reinforcement learning approaches used in Deep Research, turned up more credible sources, including an Atlantic article, to back up its claim. In a similar way, when I asked both agents to re-create the graph by making a fully functional Excel file, ChatGPT’s version worked, while Manus’s had errors.I don’t know if ChatGPT agent is better than Manus yet, but I suspect that it is far more likely to make gains faster than its competitor. To improve Manus will involve more careful crafting and bespoke work, to improve ChatGPT agents simply requires more computer chips and more examples. If the Bitter Lesson holds, the long-term outcome seems pretty clear. But more critically, the comparison between hand-crafted and outcome-trained agents points to a fundamental question about how organizations should approach AI adoption.Agents in the Garbage CanThis returns us to the world of organizations. While individuals rapidly adopt AI, companies still struggle with the Garbage Can problem, spending months mapping their chaotic processes before deploying any AI system. But what if that's backwards?The Bitter Lesson suggests we might soon ignore how companies produce outputs and focus only on the outputs themselves. Define what a good sales report or customer interaction looks like, then train AI to produce it. The AI will find its own paths through the organizational chaos; paths that might be more efficient, if more opaque, than the semi-official routes humans evolved. In a world where the Bitter Lesson holds, the despair of the CEO with his head on the table is misplaced. Instead of untangling every broken process, he just needs to define success and let AI navigate the mess. In fact, Bitter Lesson might actually be sweet: all those undocumented workflows and informal networks that pervade organizations might not matter. What matters is knowing good output when you see it.If this is true, the Garbage Can remains, but we no longer need to sort through it while competitive advantage itself gets redefined. The effort companies spent refining processes, building institutional knowledge, and creating competitive moats through operational excellence might matter less than they think. If AI agents can train on outputs alone, any organization that can define quality and provide enough examples might achieve similar results, whether they understand their own processes or not.Or it might be that the Garbage Can wins, that human complexity and those messy, evolved processes are too intricate for AI to navigate without understanding them. We're about to find out which kind of problem organizations really are: chess games that yield to computational scale, or something fundamentally messier. The companies betting on either answer are already making their moves, and we will soon get to learn what game we're actually playing.Subscribe nowShare",

      "description": "Learning without training: The implicit dynamics of in-context learningSummary: One of the most remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models is in-context learning, the ability to adapt to new patterns at inference time without any updates to model weights. Even when these patterns were absent during training, LLMs can generalize from examples provided in the prompt. Despite this impressive behavior, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, we demonstrate that stacking a self-attention layer with an MLP enables the transformer block to implicitly adjust the MLP’s effective weights based on the prompt context. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we argue that this simple architectural feature may explain how LLMs perform in-context learning, effectively converting the prompt into a low-rank weight update within the MLP layer.Read PaperGemini 2.5 Pro Capable of Winning Gold at IMO 2025Summary: The International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) features some of the most demanding math problems in the world requiring deep insight, creativity, and rigorous reasoning. While Large Language Models excel at standardized benchmarks like AIME, they often falter at Olympiad-level challenges. We tested Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro on the newly released IMO 2025 problems, carefully avoiding any data contamination. Using a self-verification pipeline and thoughtfully crafted prompts, the model successfully solved 5 out of 6 problems. This result highlights the growing promise of advanced LLMs in tackling high-level mathematical reasoning provided they’re guided by well-designed prompting and evaluation strategies.Read PaperDeep Researcher with Test-Time DiffusionSummary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made strides in automated research, yet they often plateau when generating long-form, complex reports using generic test-time scaling techniques. We introduce TTD-DR (Test-Time Diffusion Deep Researcher), a novel framework that models research report generation as a diffusion process. TTD-DR begins with an initial draft scaffold, which is iteratively refined through a de-noising process guided by retrieval-augmented context at each step. A self-evolutionary mechanism is applied across the agentic workflow, enhancing reasoning, retrieval, and composition dynamically during generation. This draft-centric, iterative architecture improves coherence, preserves context, and significantly boosts performance on multi-hop, high-complexity research benchmarks, surpassing existing deep research agents.Read PaperDiffusion Beats Autoregressive in Data-Constrained SettingsSummary: In data-constrained yet compute-abundant scenarios, masked diffusion language models significantly outperform traditional autoregressive (AR) models. This performance gain is attributed to implicit data augmentation, where the masked prediction task exposes the model to diverse token orderings, unlike the fixed left-to-right factorization of AR models. Consequently, diffusion models achieve lower validation loss and superior downstream performance by making more effective use of repeated data. The paper introduces new scaling laws for diffusion models and derives a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold where their advantage emerges. These findings establish diffusion models as a compelling alternative to the AR paradigm when data, not compute, is the primary training bottleneck.Read PaperThinkAct: Vision-Language-Action Reasoning via Reinforced Visual Latent PlanningSummary: ThinkAct proposes a dual-system VLA architecture that decouples high-level reasoning from low-level control via \"reinforced visual latent planning.\" Initially, a multimodal LLM generates symbolic, embodied reasoning plans, which are optimized using reinforcement learning with action-aligned visual rewards targeting goal completion and trajectory consistency. These optimized plans are then compressed into a compact visual plan latent, which directly conditions a downstream action policy for robust, adaptive execution in dynamic environments.Read PaperSubscribe for latest in the world of AI Research!",

      "description": "\n\n\n\n\nIt seems YouTube is finally giving its TV app the AI feature that lets you skip to the most interesting parts of a video. Android Authority’s Mishaal Rahman reports that the Jump Ahead perk for YouTube Premium subscribers appeared on his Nvidia Shield TV yesterday, a feature that was previously exclusive to YouTube’s web and mobile platforms.\nJump Ahead gives users an easy way to automatically get to the best bits of a video by using AI to analyze the most-watched segments that viewers typically skip to. YouTube started testing the feature last year before later releasing it for Premium subscribers on web and mobile, but those who prefer watching on the big screen — which is now the primary viewing source in the US — have been left wanting until now.\nPremium subscribers can activate Jump Ahead by double-tapping the fast-forward button on the video player, which then takes viewers to the next point in the video that most users view. This works differently on TVs, according to YouTube’s support page, requiring users to press the right arrow on their remote to see the next most-watched section, as indicated by a dot on the progress bar. Pressing the right arrow again will then take users to that point in the video, instead of skipping ahead by ten seconds as usual. Rahman says that a message reading “Jumping over commonly skipped section” appeared when using the feature.\n\nWhile YouTube’s support page confirms that Jump Ahead is now “available on Living Room,” the scale and pace of the rollout are unclear. The feature doesn’t appear to be widely available on TVs yet, and YouTube hasn’t made a launch announcement. A Reddit user has reported seeing the feature appear on their Samsung TV, however, and Android Police also spotted it on a Google TV streamer. We have asked Google for clarity on the rollout.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21067v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Current AI systems rely on opaque reasoning processes that hinder human oversight and collaborative potential. Conventional explainable AI approaches offer post-hoc justifications and often fail to establish genuine symbiotic collaboration. In this paper, the Symbiotic Epistemology is presented as a philosophical foundation for human-AI cognitive partnerships. Unlike frameworks that treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions AI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human confidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and confidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as a formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is empirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's adaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive intervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for high-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations. It also integrates confidence quantification, declarative control over AI behavior, and context inheritance for multi-agent coordination. By structuring communication and embedding confidence-calibrated transparency, SynLang, together with symbiotic epistemology, enables AI systems that enhance human intelligence, preserve human agency, and uphold ethical accountability in collaborative decision-making. Through dual-level transparency, beginning with high-level reasoning patterns and progressing to granular explanations, the protocol facilitates rapid comprehension and supports thorough verification of AI decision-making.",

Incorporating LLMs into the module development process has the potential to reduce development time, reduce required expertise, expand model diversity, and improve the overall quality of synthetic patient data. We demonstrate four ways that LLMs can support Synthea module creation: generating a disease profile, generating a disease module from a disease profile, evaluating an existing Synthea module, and refining an existing module. We introduce the concept of progressive refinement, which involves iteratively evaluating the LLM-generated module by checking its syntactic correctness and clinical accuracy, and then using that information to modify the module. While the use of LLMs in this context shows promise, we also acknowledge the challenges and limitations, such as the need for human oversight, the importance of rigorous testing and validation, and the potential for inaccuracies in LLM-generated content.

In parallel, we propose meta-alignment as the fidelity of the monitoring process that governs retraining or override triggers, and show that it is formally reducible to primary alignment via threshold fidelity. Our implementation spans a scalable operational loop involving scenario scoring, threshold tuning, policy validation, and structured feedback ingestion, including \"likes\", overrides, and abstentions. We provide formal convergence results under stochastic feedback and show that both alignment loss and monitoring fidelity converge additively. Empirically, NPO demonstrates measurable value in hyperscale deployment settings. A simulation-based artifact and ablation studies further illustrate the theoretical principles in action.

This paper investigates these failure modes through three experiments: (1) a multiple-choice evaluation to measure model stability against user pressure; (2) a free-response analysis using a novel safety typology and an LLM Judge; and (3) a mechanistic interpretability experiment to steer model behavior by manipulating a \"high-stakes\" activation vector. Our results show that while some models exhibit sycophancy, others like o4-mini remain robust. Top-performing models achieve high safety scores by frequently asking clarifying questions, a key feature of a safe, inquisitive approach, rather than issuing prescriptive advice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a model's cautiousness can be directly controlled via activation steering, suggesting a new path for safety alignment.

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21158v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Effective human-AI teaming heavily depends on swift trust, particularly in high-stakes scenarios such as emergency response, where timely and accurate decision-making is critical. In these time-sensitive and cognitively demanding settings, adaptive explainability is essential for fostering trust between human operators and AI systems. However, existing explainable AI (XAI) approaches typically offer uniform explanations and rely heavily on explicit feedback mechanisms, which are often impractical in such high-pressure scenarios. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual framework for adaptive XAI that operates non-intrusively by responding to users' real-time cognitive and emotional states through implicit feedback, thereby enhancing swift trust in high-stakes environments. The proposed adaptive explainability trust framework (AXTF) leverages physiological and behavioral signals, such as EEG, ECG, and eye tracking, to infer user states and support explanation adaptation. At its core is a multi-objective, personalized trust estimation model that maps workload, stress, and emotion to dynamic trust estimates. These estimates guide the modulation of explanation features enabling responsive and personalized support that promotes swift trust in human-AI collaboration. This conceptual framework establishes a foundation for developing adaptive, non-intrusive XAI systems tailored to the rigorous demands of high-pressure, time-sensitive environments.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21159v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The collaborativeness of large language models (LLMs) has proven effective in natural language processing systems, holding considerable promise for healthcare development. However, it lacks explicit component selection rules, necessitating human intervention or clinical-specific validation. Moreover, existing architectures heavily rely on a predefined LLM cluster, where partial LLMs underperform in medical decision support scenarios, invalidating the collaborativeness of LLMs. To this end, we propose an adaptive cluster collaborativeness methodology involving self-diversity and cross-consistency maximization mechanisms to boost LLMs medical decision support capacity. For the self-diversity, we calculate the fuzzy matching value of pairwise outputs within an LLM as its self-diversity value, subsequently prioritizing LLMs with high self-diversity values as cluster components in a training-free manner. For the cross-consistency, we first measure cross-consistency values between the LLM with the highest self-diversity value and others, and then gradually mask out the LLM having the lowest cross-consistency value to eliminate the potential inconsistent output during the collaborative propagation. Extensive experiments on two specialized medical datasets, NEJMQA and MMLU-Pro-health, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across physician-oriented specialties. For example, on NEJMQA, our method achieves the accuracy rate up to the publicly official passing score across all disciplines, especially achieving ACC of 65.47\\% compared to the 56.12\\% achieved by GPT-4 on the Obstetrics and Gynecology discipline.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21162v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources into active distribution networks (ADNs) has made effective ADN dispatch imperative. However, the numerous newly-integrated ADN operators, such as distribution system aggregators, virtual power plant managers, and end prosumers, often lack specialized expertise in power system operation, modeling, optimization, and programming. This knowledge gap renders reliance on human experts both costly and time-intensive. To address this challenge and enable intelligent, flexible ADN dispatch, this paper proposes a large language model (LLM) powered automated modeling and optimization approach. First, the ADN dispatch problems are decomposed into sequential stages, and a multi-LLM coordination architecture is designed. This framework comprises an Information Extractor, a Problem Formulator, and a Code Programmer, tasked with information retrieval, optimization problem formulation, and code implementation, respectively. Afterwards, tailored refinement techniques are developed for each LLM agent, greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of generated content. The proposed approach features a user-centric interface that enables ADN operators to derive dispatch strategies via simple natural language queries, eliminating technical barriers and increasing efficiency. Comprehensive comparisons and end-to-end demonstrations on various test cases validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and methods.",

In this paradigm, agents interact directly with one another to plan, coordinate, and execute complex tasks on behalf of users. This transition from human-driven to machine-to-machine interaction allows intent to be delegated, relieving users from routine digital operations and enabling a more interactive, automated web experience. In this paper, we present a structured framework for understanding and building the Agentic Web. We trace its evolution from the PC and Mobile Web eras and identify the core technological foundations that support this shift. Central to our framework is a conceptual model consisting of three key dimensions: intelligence, interaction, and economics. These dimensions collectively enable the capabilities of AI agents, such as retrieval, recommendation, planning, and collaboration. We analyze the architectural and infrastructural challenges involved in creating scalable agentic systems, including communication protocols, orchestration strategies, and emerging paradigms such as the Agent Attention Economy.

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21276v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Modern deployment of large language models (LLMs) frequently involves both inference serving and continuous retraining to stay aligned with evolving data and user feedback. Common practices separate these workloads onto distinct servers in isolated phases, causing substantial inefficiencies (e.g., GPU idleness) and delayed adaptation to new data in distributed settings. Our empirical analysis reveals that these inefficiencies stem from dynamic request arrivals during serving and workload heterogeneity in pipeline-parallel training. To address these challenges, we propose LeMix, a system for co-locating and managing concurrent LLM serving and training workloads. LeMix integrates offline profiling, execution prediction mechanisms, and runtime scheduling to dynamically adapt resource allocation based on workload characteristics and system conditions. By understanding task-specific behaviors and co-execution interference across shared nodes, LeMix improves utilization and serving quality without compromising serving responsiveness. Our evaluation shows that LeMix improves throughput by up to 3.53x, reduces inference loss by up to 0.61x, and delivers up to 2.12x higher response time SLO attainment over traditional separate setups. To our knowledge, this is the first work to uncover and exploit the opportunities of joint LLM inference and training, paving the way for more resource-efficient deployment of LLMs in production environments.",

We test two treatment conditions. First, a \"naive\" AI use condition in which annotators use only the tool and must accept the first answer they are given. And second, an \"interactive\" AI treatment condition where annotators use the tool interactively, and use their judgement to follow-up with additional information if necessary. Compared to the human-only baseline, the use of the AI tool accelerated task execution by up to a factor of 10 and enhanced task accuracy, particularly in the interactive condition. We find that when extrapolated to the full task, these methods could save up to 268 hours compared to the human-only approach.

Traditional methods, such as simple moving averages, struggle to address dynamic market conditions. Emerging machine learning techniques, including LSTM, reinforcement learning, and XGBoost, offer potential solutions but are limited by computational complexity, training inefficiencies, or constraints in time-series modeling. Liquid Neural Networks, inspired by dynamic biological systems, present a promising alternative due to their adaptability, low computational cost, and robustness to noise, making them suitable for real-time decision-making and edge computing. Despite their success in applications like autonomous vehicles and medical monitoring, their potential in supply chain optimization remains underexplored. This study introduces a hybrid LNN and XGBoost model to optimize ordering strategies in multi-tier supply chains. By leveraging LNN's dynamic feature extraction and XGBoost's global optimization capabilities, the model aims to mitigate the bullwhip effect and enhance cumulative profitability.

However, current LLMs often falter in real-world settings, defaulting to passive responses or narrow clarifications when faced with incomplete or under-specified prompts, falling short of proactively gathering the missing information that is crucial for high-quality solutions. In this work, we introduce a new task paradigm: proactive information gathering, where LLMs must identify gaps in the provided context and strategically elicit implicit user knowledge through targeted questions. To systematically study and train this capability, we design a scalable framework that generates partially specified, real-world tasks, masking key information and simulating authentic ambiguity. Within this setup, our core innovation is a reinforcement finetuning strategy that rewards questions that elicit genuinely new, implicit user information -- such as hidden domain expertise or fine-grained requirements -- that would otherwise remain unspoken. Experiments demonstrate that our trained Qwen-2.5-7B model significantly outperforms o3-mini by 18% on automatic evaluation metrics. More importantly, human evaluation reveals that clarification questions and final outlines generated by our model are favored by human annotators by 42% and 28% respectively. Together, these results highlight the value of proactive clarification in elevating LLMs from passive text generators to genuinely collaborative thought partners.",

Large Language Models (LLMs) possess vast unstructured knowledge but struggle with maintaining structured consistency. We propose Evo-DKD, a novel dual-decoder framework for autonomous ontology evolution that combines structured ontology traversal with unstructured text reasoning. Evo-DKD introduces two parallel decoding streams within an LLM: one decoder generates candidate ontology edits (e.g., new concepts or relations) while the other produces natural-language justifications. A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two streams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured knowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using prompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a single-stream mode. The system operates in a closed reasoning loop: proposed ontology edits are validated (via consistency checks and cross-verification with the text explanations) and then injected into the knowledge base, which in turn informs subsequent reasoning. We demonstrate Evo-DKD's effectiveness on use cases including healthcare ontology refinement, semantic search improvement, and cultural heritage timeline modeling. Experiments show that Evo-DKD outperforms baselines using structured-only or unstructured-only decoding in both precision of ontology updates and downstream task performance. We present quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, confirming the contributions of the dual-decoder design and gating router.

Sherpa Rx integrated Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines with Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) data to generate contextually relevant responses. A dataset (N=260 queries) spanning 26 CPIC guidelines was used to evaluate drug-gene interactions, dosing recommendations, and therapeutic implications. In Phase 1, only CPIC data was embedded. Phase 2 additionally incorporated PharmGKB content. Responses were scored on accuracy, relevance, clarity, completeness (5-point Likert scale), and recall. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests compared accuracy between Phase 1 and Phase 2, and between Phase 2 and ChatGPT-4omini. A 20-question quiz assessed the tool's real-world applicability against other models. In Phase 1 (N=260), Sherpa Rx demonstrated high performance of accuracy 4.9, relevance 5.0, clarity 5.0, completeness 4.8, and recall 0.99. The subset analysis (N=20) showed improvements in accuracy (4.6 vs. 4.4, Phase 2 vs. Phase 1 subset) and completeness (5.0 vs. 4.8). ChatGPT-4omini performed comparably in relevance (5.0) and clarity (4.9) but lagged in accuracy (3.9) and completeness (4.2). Differences in accuracy between Phase 1 and Phase 2 was not statistically significant. However, Phase 2 significantly outperformed ChatGPT-4omini. On the 20-question quiz, Sherpa Rx achieved 90% accuracy, outperforming other models. Integrating additional resources like CPIC and PharmGKB with RAG enhances AI accuracy and performance. This study highlights the transformative potential of generative AI like Sherpa Rx in pharmacogenomics, improving decision-making with accurate, personalized responses.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21471v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Infrared spectroscopy offers rapid, non destructive measurement of chemical and material properties but suffers from high dimensional, overlapping spectral bands that challenge conventional chemometric approaches. Emerging large language models (LLMs), with their capacity for generalization and reasoning, offer promising potential for automating complex scientific workflows. Despite this promise, their application in IR spectral analysis remains largely unexplored. This study addresses the critical challenge of achieving accurate, automated infrared spectral interpretation under low-data conditions using an LLM-driven framework. We introduce an end-to-end, large language model driven agent framework that integrates a structured literature knowledge base, automated spectral preprocessing, feature extraction, and multi task reasoning in a unified pipeline. By querying a curated corpus of peer reviewed IR publications, the agent selects scientifically validated routines. The selected methods transform each spectrum into low dimensional feature sets, which are fed into few shot prompt templates for classification, regression, and anomaly detection. A closed loop, multi turn protocol iteratively appends mispredicted samples to the prompt, enabling dynamic refinement of predictions. Across diverse materials: stamp pad ink, Chinese medicine, Pu'er tea, Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium and waste water COD datasets, the multi turn LLM consistently outperforms single turn inference, rivaling or exceeding machine learning and deep learning models under low data regimes.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21488v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As humans seek to collaborate with, learn from, and better understand artificial intelligence systems, developing AIs that can accurately emulate individual decision-making becomes increasingly important. Chess, a long-standing AI benchmark with precise skill measurement, offers an ideal testbed for human-AI alignment. However, existing approaches to modeling human behavior require prohibitively large amounts of data from each individual, making them impractical for new or sparsely represented users. In this work, we introduce Maia4All, a framework designed to learn and adapt to individual decision-making styles efficiently, even with limited data. Maia4All achieves this through a two-stage optimization process: (1) an enrichment step, which bridges population and individual-level human behavior modeling with a prototype-enriched model, and (2) a democratization step, which leverages ability levels or user prototypes to initialize and refine individual embeddings with minimal data. Our experimental results show that Maia4All can accurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high fidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior modeling in chess. Maia4All achieves individual human behavior modeling in chess with only 20 games, compared to the 5,000 games required previously, representing a significant improvement in data efficiency. Our work provides an example of how population AI systems can flexibly adapt to individual users using a prototype-enriched model as a bridge. This approach extends beyond chess, as shown in our case study on idiosyncratic LLMs, highlighting its potential for broader applications in personalized AI adaptation.",

Over the last few decades, advances in computation and information technologies have enabled the transition from manual, intuition and experience-based decision-making, into more automated and data-driven decisions using a variety of tools that apply optimization techniques. These techniques use mathematical methods to improve decision-making.\n  Unfortunately, business planners and executives still need to spend considerable time and effort to (i) understand and explain the recommendations coming out of these technologies; (ii) analyze various scenarios and answer what-if questions; and (iii) update the mathematical models used in these tools to reflect current business environments. Addressing these challenges requires involving data science teams and/or the technology providers to explain results or make the necessary changes in the technology and hence significantly slows down decision making.\n  Motivated by the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), we report how this disruptive technology can democratize supply chain technology - namely, facilitate the understanding of tools' outcomes, as well as the interaction with supply chain tools without human-in-the-loop. Specifically, we report how we apply LLMs to address the three challenges described above, thus substantially reducing the time to decision from days and weeks to minutes and hours as well as dramatically increasing planners' and executives' productivity and impact.",

Despite substantial work investigating the trustworthiness of language models, MMLMs' capability to act honestly, especially when faced with visually unanswerable questions, remains largely underexplored. This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty behaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors to unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such questions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark, consisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by multi-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked the honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our findings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when necessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but is deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of dedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment. Therefore, we implemented initial alignment methods using supervised and preference learning to improve honesty behavior, providing a foundation for future work on trustworthy MLLMs. Our data and code can be found at https://github.com/DSTTSD/MoHoBench.",

Existing methods often struggle to model dense spatial-temporal interactions, leading to scalability issues and multi-dancer collisions. To address these challenges, we propose ST-GDance, a novel framework that decouples spatial and temporal dependencies to optimize long-term and collision-free group choreography. We employ lightweight graph convolutions for distance-aware spatial modeling and accelerated sparse attention for efficient temporal modeling. This design significantly reduces computational costs while ensuring smooth and collision-free interactions.

However, existing research has largely overlooked the evaluation of these models in traffic safety-critical driving scenarios. To bridge this gap, we create the benchmark (SafeDrive228K) and propose a new baseline based on VLM with knowledge graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (SafeDriveRAG) for visual question answering (VQA). Specifically, we introduce SafeDrive228K, the first large-scale multimodal question-answering benchmark comprising 228K examples across 18 sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses a diverse range of traffic safety queries, from traffic accidents and corner cases to common safety knowledge, enabling a thorough assessment of the comprehension and reasoning abilities of the models. Furthermore, we propose a plug-and-play multimodal knowledge graph-based retrieval-augmented generation approach that employs a novel multi-scale subgraph retrieval algorithm for efficient information retrieval. By incorporating traffic safety guidelines collected from the Internet, this framework further enhances the model's capacity to handle safety-critical situations. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on five mainstream VLMs to assess their reliability in safety-sensitive driving tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating RAG significantly improves performance, achieving a +4.73% gain in Traffic Accidents tasks, +8.79% in Corner Cases tasks and +14.57% in Traffic Safety Commonsense across five mainstream VLMs, underscoring the potential of our proposed benchmark and methodology for advancing research in traffic safety.

The challenge of the problem is how to preserve the old task knowledge while facilitating the learning of new task with previous experiences. To address these challenges, we introduce a three-stage Progressive Homeostatic and Plastic audio-visual prompt (PHP) method. In the shallow phase, we design the task-shared modality aggregating adapter to foster cross-task and cross-modal audio-visual representation learning to enhance shared understanding between tasks. In the middle phase, we propose the task-specific modality-shared dynamic generating adapter, which constructs prompts that are tailored to individual tasks while remaining general across modalities, which balances the models ability to retain knowledge against forgetting with its potential for versatile multi-task transferability. In the deep phase, we introduce the task-specific modality-independent prompts to further refine the understand ability by targeting individual information for each task and modality. By incorporating these three phases, PHP retains task-specific prompts while adapting shared parameters for new tasks to effectively balance knowledge sharing and specificity.

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21589v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Embodied intelligence posits that cognitive capabilities fundamentally emerge from - and are shaped by - an agent's real-time sensorimotor interactions with its environment. Such adaptive behavior inherently requires continuous inference under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics offers a principled probabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as probability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The core computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including perception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can be effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite the deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied intelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in today's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian and contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental lenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as highlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay \"The Bitter Lesson\". This analysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in the development of modern embodied intelligence. At the same time, it reveals that current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to closed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian methods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open physical-world embodied intelligence.",

In this work, we investigate their use for two tightly intertwined challenges in workforce management: staffing, i.e., the assignment and scheduling of tasks to workers, which may require team formation; and profiling, i.e., the continuous estimation of workers' skills, preferences, and other latent attributes from unstructured data. We cast these problems in a formal mathematical framework that links scheduling decisions to latent feature estimation, and we introduce StaffPro, an LLM agent that addresses staffing and profiling jointly. Differently from existing staffing solutions, StaffPro allows expressing optimization objectives using natural language, accepts textual task descriptions and provides high flexibility. StaffPro interacts directly with humans by establishing a continuous human-agent feedback loop, ensuring natural and intuitive use. By analyzing human feedback, our agent continuously estimates the latent features of workers, realizing life-long worker profiling and ensuring optimal staffing performance over time. A consulting firm simulation example demonstrates that StaffPro successfully estimates workers' attributes and generates high quality schedules. With its innovative design, StaffPro offers a robust, interpretable, and human-centric solution for automated personnel management.",

While games such as Go and Atari have led to many breakthroughs, they often do not directly translate to real-world embodied applications. In recognising the need to diversify RL benchmarks and addressing complexities that arise in embodied interaction scenarios, we introduce Assistax: an open-source benchmark designed to address challenges arising in assistive robotics tasks. Assistax uses JAX's hardware acceleration for significant speed-ups for learning in physics-based simulations. In terms of open-loop wall-clock time, Assistax runs up to $370\\times$ faster when vectorising training runs compared to CPU-based alternatives. Assistax conceptualises the interaction between an assistive robot and an active human patient using multi-agent RL to train a population of diverse partner agents against which an embodied robotic agent's zero-shot coordination capabilities can be tested. Extensive evaluation and hyperparameter tuning for popular continuous control RL and MARL algorithms provide reliable baselines and establish Assistax as a practical benchmark for advancing RL research for assistive robotics.

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21705v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental tool used across many engineering fields. The main goal of DP is to solve Bellman's optimality equations for a given Markov decision process (MDP). Standard methods like policy iteration exploit the fixed-point nature of these equations to solve them iteratively. However, these algorithms can be computationally expensive when the state-action space is large or when the problem involves long-term dependencies. Here we propose a new approach that unrolls and truncates policy iterations into a learnable parametric model dubbed BellNet, which we train to minimize the so-termed Bellman error from random value function initializations. Viewing the transition probability matrix of the MDP as the adjacency of a weighted directed graph, we draw insights from graph signal processing to interpret (and compactly re-parameterize) BellNet as a cascade of nonlinear graph filters. This fresh look facilitates a concise, transferable, and unifying representation of policy and value iteration, with an explicit handle on complexity during inference. Preliminary experiments conducted in a grid-like environment demonstrate that BellNet can effectively approximate optimal policies in a fraction of the iterations required by classical methods.",

To address this challenge, we proposed Graph Domain Adaptation for Individual Parcellation (GDAIP), a novel framework that integrates Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Minimax Entropy (MME)-based domain adaptation. We construct cross-dataset brain graphs at both the group and individual levels. By leveraging semi-supervised training and adversarial optimization of the prediction entropy on unlabeled vertices from target brain graph, the reference atlas is adapted from the group-level brain graph to the individual brain graph, enabling individual parcellation under cross-dataset settings.

In the real world, observations are always collected in different environments with heterogeneous causal relationships. Therefore, on observation data, this paper proposes a Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Inference model (MCVCI) to infer heterogeneous causality. Specifically, according to the identifiability of the Hybrid Additive Noise Model (HANM), MCVCI combines the superior fitting capabilities of the Gaussian mixture model and the neural network and elegantly uses the likelihoods obtained from the probabilistic bounds of the mixture conditional variational auto-encoder as causal decision criteria. Moreover, we model the casual heterogeneity into cluster numbers and propose the Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Clustering (MCVCC) method, which can reveal causal mechanism expression.

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21802v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Although GRPO substantially enhances flow matching models in human preference alignment of image generation, methods such as FlowGRPO still exhibit inefficiency due to the necessity of sampling and optimizing over all denoising steps specified by the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we propose $\\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence. Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling. So we present a faster variant, termed $\\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment, outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50% lower training time.

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21830v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications. Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively, methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs, rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation. Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21872v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Autonomous driving systems rely heavily on multimodal perception data to understand complex environments. However, the long-tailed distribution of real-world data hinders generalization, especially for rare but safety-critical vehicle categories. To address this challenge, we propose MultiEditor, a dual-branch latent diffusion framework designed to edit images and LiDAR point clouds in driving scenarios jointly. At the core of our approach is introducing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a structural and appearance prior for target objects. Leveraging this prior, we design a multi-level appearance control mechanism--comprising pixel-level pasting, semantic-level guidance, and multi-branch refinement--to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction across modalities. We further propose a depth-guided deformable cross-modality condition module that adaptively enables mutual guidance between modalities using 3DGS-rendered depth, significantly enhancing cross-modality consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MultiEditor achieves superior performance in visual and geometric fidelity, editing controllability, and cross-modality consistency. Furthermore, generating rare-category vehicle data with MultiEditor substantially enhances the detection accuracy of perception models on underrepresented classes.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21873v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at predictive tasks on graph-structured data but often lack the ability to incorporate symbolic domain knowledge and perform general reasoning. Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs), in contrast, enable fully generative probabilistic modeling over graph-like structures and support rich symbolic knowledge and probabilistic inference. This paper presents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs, combining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning capabilities of RBNs.\n  We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs directly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an external component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational properties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also propose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic models.\n  To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct problems. First, we transform a GNN for node classification into a collective classification model that explicitly models homo- and heterophilic label patterns, substantially improving accuracy. Second, we introduce a multi-objective network optimization problem in environmental planning, where MAP inference supports complex decision-making. Both applications include new publicly available benchmark datasets.\n  This work introduces a powerful and coherent neuro-symbolic approach to graph data, bridging learning and reasoning in ways that enable novel applications and improved performance across diverse tasks.",

Every GitHub repository has a README file associated with it. The README files should contain project-related information as per the recommendations of GitHub to support the usage and improvement of repositories. However, GitHub repository owners sometimes neglected these recommendations. This prevents a GitHub repository from reaching its full potential. This research posits that the comprehensiveness of a GitHub repository's README file significantly influences its adoption and utilization, with a lack of detail potentially hindering its full potential for widespread engagement and impact within the research community. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great performance in many text-based tasks including text classification, text generation, text summarization and text translation. In this study, an approach is developed to fine-tune LLMs for automatically classifying different sections of GitHub README files. Three encoder-only LLMs are utilized, including BERT, DistilBERT and RoBERTa. These pre-trained models are then fine-tuned based on a gold-standard dataset consisting of 4226 README file sections. This approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and has achieved an overall F1 score of 0.98. Moreover, we have also investigated the use of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and shown an economical alternative to full fine-tuning without compromising much performance.

Despite their performance guarantees, such ``prompt-the-LLM'' approaches carry several risks, including privacy invasion, reliance on an external service, and inconsistent predictions due to version changes, making a case for alternative zero-shot HAR methods that do not require prompting the LLMs. In this paper, we propose one such solution that models sensor data and activities using natural language, leveraging its embeddings to perform zero-shot classification and thereby bypassing the need to prompt the LLMs for activity predictions.

      "description": "arXiv:2507.22009v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in AI-driven public health and biomedical sciences systems requires more than accurate predictions-it demands explanations that are clear, contextual, and socially accountable. While explainable AI (XAI) has advanced in areas like feature attribution and model interpretability, most methods still lack the structure and adaptability needed for diverse health stakeholders, including clinicians, policymakers, and the general public. We introduce PHAX-a Public Health Argumentation and eXplainability framework-that leverages structured argumentation to generate human-centered explanations for AI outputs. PHAX is a multi-layer architecture combining defeasible reasoning, adaptive natural language techniques, and user modeling to produce context-aware, audience-specific justifications. More specifically, we show how argumentation enhances explainability by supporting AI-driven decision-making, justifying recommendations, and enabling interactive dialogues across user types. We demonstrate the applicability of PHAX through use cases such as medical term simplification, patient-clinician communication, and policy justification. In particular, we show how simplification decisions can be modeled as argument chains and personalized based on user expertise-enhancing both interpretability and trust. By aligning formal reasoning methods with communicative demands, PHAX contributes to a broader vision of transparent, human-centered AI in public health.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.22025v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven significant advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent capabilities. Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework enhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training, we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process: 1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a \"Simple Thinking\" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy; and 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present Decomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and ScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference enhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro.",

However, their ability to proactively collaborate with users, especially when goals are vague, evolving, or indirectly expressed, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce UserBench, a user-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents in multi-turn, preference-driven interactions. UserBench features simulated users who start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally, requiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with tools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a significant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For instance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only 20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer than 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results highlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task executors, but true collaborative partners.

      "description": "arXiv:2507.17307v2 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during inference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences. Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low, and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\\% reduction in inference latency with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in accelerating CoT reasoning.",

Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the fine-tuned LLMs achieve high accuracy in generating valid contracts and reduce manual workload by over 70%.

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21074v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: As generative AI (Gen-AI) tools become more prevalent in education, there is a growing need to understand how educators, not just students, can actively shape their design and use. This study investigates how two instructors integrated four custom GPT tools into a Masters-level Qualitative Research Methods course for Urban Planning Policy students. Addressing two key gaps: the dominant framing of students as passive AI users, and the limited use of AI in qualitative methods education. The study explores how Gen-AI can support disciplinary learning when aligned with pedagogical intent. Drawing on the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework and action research methodology, the instructors designed GPTs to scaffold tasks such as research question formulation, interview practice, fieldnote analysis, and design thinking. Thematic analysis of student reflections, AI chat logs, and final assignments revealed that the tools enhanced student reflexivity, improved interview techniques, and supported structured analytic thinking. However, students also expressed concerns about cognitive overload, reduced immersion in data, and the formulaic nature of AI responses. The study offers three key insights: AI can be a powerful scaffold for active learning when paired with human facilitation; custom GPTs can serve as cognitive partners in iterative research practice; and educator-led design is critical to pedagogically meaningful AI integration. This research contributes to emerging scholarship on AI in higher education by demonstrating how empowering educators to design custom tools can promote more reflective, responsible, and collaborative learning with AI.",

Turing defined artificial intelligence as the ability to mimic human communication, and as AI development increasingly focuses on human-like agents, this benchmark remains popular. In contrast, we define Neuro-Inclusive AI as datasets and systems that move away from mimicking humanness as a benchmark for machine intelligence. Then, we explore the origins, prevalence, and impact of anti-autistic biases in current research. Our work finds that 90% of human-like AI agents exclude autistic perspectives, and AI creators continue to believe ethical considerations are beyond the scope of their work. To improve the autistic representation in data, we conduct empirical experiments with annotators and LLMs, finding that binary labeling schemes sufficiently capture the nuances of labeling anti-autistic hate speech. Our benchmark, AUTALIC, can be used to evaluate or fine-tune models, and was developed to serve as a foundation for more neuro-inclusive future work.",

We develop a computational framework for modeling explainers who consider the emotional impact an explanation might have on a listener. We test our framework by using it to model human intuitions about how a doctor might explain to a patient why they have a disease, taking into account the patient's propensity for regret.

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21083v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Large Language Models like GPT-4 adjust their responses not only based on the question asked, but also on how it is emotionally phrased. We systematically vary the emotional tone of 156 prompts - spanning controversial and everyday topics - and analyze how it affects model responses. Our findings show that GPT-4 is three times less likely to respond negatively to a negatively framed question than to a neutral one. This suggests a \"rebound\" bias where the model overcorrects, often shifting toward neutrality or positivity. On sensitive topics (e.g., justice or politics), this effect is even more pronounced: tone-based variation is suppressed, suggesting an alignment override. We introduce concepts like the \"tone floor\" - a lower bound in response negativity - and use tone-valence transition matrices to quantify behavior. Visualizations based on 1536-dimensional embeddings confirm semantic drift based on tone.

This study examines whether interactive simulations can help learners think like a scientist by engaging them in hypothesis testing, experimentation, and direct observation of AI behavior. In a controlled study with 605 participants, we assess how interactive AI tutorials impact learning of key concepts such as fairness, dataset representativeness, and bias in language models. Results show that interactive simulations effectively enhance AI literacy across topics, supporting greater knowledge transfer and self-reported confidence, though engagement alone does not predict learning.

However, these methods tend to be disconnected from the specific contexts in which CAs operate, potentially leading to misalignment with users interests. To address this challenge, we propose a novel, bottom-up approach to value alignment, utilizing the value ontology of the ISO Value-Based Engineering standard for ethical IT design. We analyse 593 ethically sensitive system outputs identified from 16,908 conversational logs of a major European employment service CA to identify core values and instances of value misalignment within real-world interactions.

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21107v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We propose Curved Inference - a geometric Interpretability framework that tracks how the residual stream trajectory of a large language model bends in response to shifts in semantic concern. Across 20 matched prompts spanning emotional, moral, perspective, logical, identity, environmental, and nonsense domains, we analyse Gemma3-1b and LLaMA3.2-3b using five native-space metrics, with a primary focus on curvature (\\k{appa}_i) and salience (S(t)). These metrics are computed under a pullback semantic metric derived from the unembedding matrix, ensuring that all measurements reflect token-aligned geometry rather than raw coordinate structure. We find that concern-shifted prompts reliably alter internal activation trajectories in both models - with LLaMA exhibiting consistent, statistically significant scaling in both curvature and salience as concern intensity increases. Gemma also responds to concern but shows weaker differentiation between moderate and strong variants. Our results support a two-layer view of LLM geometry - a latent conceptual structure encoded in the embedding space, and a contextual trajectory shaped by prompt-specific inference. Curved Inference reveals how models navigate, reorient, or reinforce semantic meaning over depth, offering a principled method for diagnosing alignment, abstraction, and emergent inference dynamics. These findings offer fresh insight into semantic abstraction and model alignment through the lens of Curved Inference.",

Automatic Legal Contract Classification (LCC) revolutionizes the way legal contracts are analyzed, offering substantial improvements in speed, accuracy, and accessibility. This survey delves into the challenges of automatic LCC and a detailed examination of key tasks, datasets, and methodologies. We identify seven classification tasks within LCC, and review fourteen datasets related to English-language contracts, including public, proprietary, and non-public sources. We also introduce a methodology taxonomy for LCC, categorized into Traditional Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Transformer-based approaches. Additionally, the survey discusses evaluation techniques and highlights the best-performing results from the reviewed studies. By providing a thorough overview of current methods and their limitations, this survey suggests future research directions to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and scalability of LCC. As the first comprehensive survey on LCC, it aims to support legal NLP researchers and practitioners in improving legal processes, making legal information more accessible, and promoting a more informed and equitable society.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21109v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Deep Neural Networks often suffer from a critical limitation known as Catastrophic Forgetting, where performance on past tasks degrades after learning new ones. This paper introduces a novel continual learning approach inspired by human learning strategies like Active Recall, Deliberate Practice and Spaced Repetition, named Task Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall (TFC-SR). TFC-SR enhances the standard experience replay with a mechanism we termed the Active Recall Probe. It is a periodic, task-aware evaluation of the model's memory that stabilizes the representations of past knowledge. We test TFC-SR on the Split MNIST and Split CIFAR-100 benchmarks against leading regularization-based and replay-based baselines. Our results show that TFC-SR performs significantly better than these methods. For instance, on the Split CIFAR-100, it achieves a final accuracy of 13.17% compared to standard replay's 7.40%. We demonstrate that this advantage comes from the stabilizing effect of the probe itself, and not from the difference in replay volume. Additionally, we analyze the trade-off between memory size and performance and show that while TFC-SR performs better in memory-constrained environments, higher replay volume is still more effective when available memory is abundant. We conclude that TFC-SR is a robust and efficient approach, highlighting the importance of integrating active memory retrieval mechanisms into continual learning systems.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21117v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Recommender systems have traditionally followed modular architectures comprising candidate generation, multi-stage ranking, and re-ranking, each trained separately with supervised objectives and hand-engineered features. While effective in many domains, such systems face persistent challenges including sparse and noisy interaction data, cold-start problems, limited personalization depth, and inadequate semantic understanding of user and item content. The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a new paradigm for addressing these limitations through unified, language-native mechanisms that can generalize across tasks, domains, and modalities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive technical survey of how LLMs can be leveraged to tackle key challenges in modern recommender systems. We examine the use of LLMs for prompt-driven candidate retrieval, language-native ranking, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and conversational recommendation, illustrating how these approaches enhance personalization, semantic alignment, and interpretability without requiring extensive task-specific supervision. LLMs further enable zero- and few-shot reasoning, allowing systems to operate effectively in cold-start and long-tail scenarios by leveraging external knowledge and contextual cues. We categorize these emerging LLM-driven architectures and analyze their effectiveness in mitigating core bottlenecks of conventional pipelines. In doing so, we provide a structured framework for understanding the design space of LLM-enhanced recommenders, and outline the trade-offs between accuracy, scalability, and real-time performance.

Users initially access core functionalities--such as threshold-based filtering, slice extraction, and statistical analysis--through pre-existing tools. For tasks beyond this baseline, VizGenie autonomously employs LLMs to generate new visualization scripts (e.g., VTK Python code), expanding its capabilities on-demand. Each generated script undergoes automated backend validation and is seamlessly integrated upon successful testing, continuously enhancing the system's adaptability and robustness. A distinctive feature of VizGenie is its intuitive natural language interface, allowing users to issue high-level feature-based queries (e.g., ``visualize the skull\"). The system leverages image-based analysis and visual question answering (VQA) via fine-tuned vision models to interpret these queries precisely, bridging domain expertise and technical implementation. Additionally, users can interactively query generated visualizations through VQA, facilitating deeper exploration. Reliability and reproducibility are further strengthened by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), providing context-driven responses while maintaining comprehensive provenance records. Evaluations on complex volumetric datasets demonstrate significant reductions in cognitive overhead for iterative visualization tasks.

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21146v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Evolving AI systems increasingly deploy multi-agent architectures where autonomous agents collaborate, share information, and delegate tasks through developing protocols. This connectivity, while powerful, introduces novel security risks. One such risk is a cascading risk: a breach in one agent can cascade through the system, compromising others by exploiting inter-agent trust. In tandem with OWASP's initiative for an Agentic AI Vulnerability Scoring System we define an attack vector, Agent Cascading Injection, analogous to Agent Impact Chain and Blast Radius, operating across networks of agents. In an ACI attack, a malicious input or tool exploit injected at one agent leads to cascading compromises and amplified downstream effects across agents that trust its outputs. We formalize this attack with an adversarial goal equation and key variables (compromised agent, injected exploit, polluted observations, etc.), capturing how a localized vulnerability can escalate into system-wide failure. We then analyze ACI's properties -- propagation chains, amplification factors, and inter-agent compound effects -- and map these to OWASP's emerging Agentic AI risk categories (e.g. Impact Chain and Orchestration Exploits). Finally, we argue that ACI highlights a critical need for quantitative benchmarking frameworks to evaluate the security of agent-to-agent communication protocols. We outline a methodology for stress-testing multi-agent systems (using architectures such as Google's A2A and Anthropic's MCP) against cascading trust failures, developing upon groundwork for measurable, standardized agent-to-agent security evaluation. Our work provides the necessary apparatus for engineers to benchmark system resilience, make data-driven architectural trade-offs, and develop robust defenses against a new generation of agentic threats.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21147v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Wildfires significantly impact natural ecosystems and human health, leading to biodiversity loss, increased hydrogeological risks, and elevated emissions of toxic substances. Climate change exacerbates these effects, particularly in regions with rising temperatures and prolonged dry periods, such as the Mediterranean. This requires the development of advanced risk management strategies that utilize state-of-the-art technologies. However, in this context, the data show a bias toward an imbalanced setting, where the incidence of wildfire events is significantly lower than typical situations. This imbalance, coupled with the inherent complexity of high-dimensional spatio-temporal data, poses significant challenges for training deep learning architectures. Moreover, since precise wildfire predictions depend mainly on weather data, finding a way to reduce computational costs to enable more frequent updates using the latest weather forecasts would be beneficial. This paper investigates how adopting a contrastive framework can address these challenges through enhanced latent representations for the patch's dynamic features. We thus introduce a new morphology-based curriculum contrastive learning that mitigates issues associated with diverse regional characteristics and enables the use of smaller patch sizes without compromising performance.

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21163v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Adversarial attack methods for 3D point cloud classification reveal the vulnerabilities of point cloud recognition models. This vulnerability could lead to safety risks in critical applications that use deep learning models, such as autonomous vehicles. To uncover the deficiencies of these models, researchers can evaluate their security through adversarial attacks. However, most existing adversarial attack methods are based on white-box attacks. While these methods achieve high attack success rates and imperceptibility, their applicability in real-world scenarios is limited. Black-box attacks, which are more meaningful in real-world scenarios, often yield poor results. This paper proposes a novel black-box adversarial example generation method that utilizes a diffusion model to improve the attack success rate and imperceptibility in the black-box setting, without relying on the internal information of the point cloud classification model to generate adversarial samples. We use a 3D diffusion model to use the compressed features of the point cloud as prior knowledge to guide the reverse diffusion process to add adversarial points to clean examples. Subsequently, its reverse process is employed to transform the distribution of other categories into adversarial points, which are then added to the point cloud.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21164v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to detect anomalies without labeled data, a necessity in many machine learning applications where anomalous samples are rare or not available. Most state-of-the-art methods fall into two categories: reconstruction-based approaches, which often reconstruct anomalies too well, and decoupled representation learning with density estimators, which can suffer from suboptimal feature spaces. While some recent methods attempt to couple feature learning and anomaly detection, they often rely on surrogate objectives, restrict kernel choices, or introduce approximations that limit their expressiveness and robustness. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method that tightly couples representation learning with an analytically solvable one-class SVM (OCSVM), through a custom loss formulation that directly aligns latent features with the OCSVM decision boundary. The model is evaluated on two tasks: a new benchmark based on MNIST-C, and a challenging brain MRI subtle lesion detection task. Unlike most methods that focus on large, hyperintense lesions at the image level, our approach succeeds to target small, non-hyperintense lesions, while we evaluate voxel-wise metrics, addressing a more clinically relevant scenario. Both experiments evaluate a form of robustness to domain shifts, including corruption types in MNIST-C and scanner/age variations in MRI. Results demonstrate performance and robustness of our proposed mode,highlighting its potential for general UAD and real-world medical imaging applications.

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21167v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Charts are a fundamental visualization format widely used in data analysis across research and industry. While enabling users to edit charts based on high-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily rely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support fine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for multimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination of natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the elements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present Chart$\\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with Multi-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. Chart$\\text{M}^3$ contains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample includes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions). To comprehensively evaluate chart editing models, Chart$\\text{M}^3$ provides metrics that assess both visual appearance and code correctness. Our benchmark reveals significant limitations in current multimodal large language models (MLLMs), including GPT-4o, particularly in their ability to interpret and act on visual indicators. To address this, we construct Chart$\\text{M}^3$-Train, a large-scale training set with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples. Fine-tuning MLLMs on this dataset leads to substantial improvements, demonstrating the importance of multimodal supervision in building practical chart editing systems.

Clinical notes are generated using a structured prompting pipeline grounded in diagnostic reasoning, then perturbed along four axes: masking, negation, synonym replacement, and numeric variation to simulate common ambiguities and omissions. We compute LDFR across both foundation and clinical LLMs, finding that latent fragility emerges even under minimal surface-level changes. Finally, we validate our findings on 90 real clinical notes from the DiReCT benchmark (MIMIC-IV), confirming the generalizability of LDFR beyond synthetic settings.

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21198v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The gradient inversion attack has been demonstrated as a significant privacy threat to federated learning (FL), particularly in continuous domains such as vision models. In contrast, it is often considered less effective or highly dependent on impractical training settings when applied to language models, due to the challenges posed by the discrete nature of tokens in text data. As a result, its potential privacy threats remain largely underestimated, despite FL being an emerging training method for language models. In this work, we propose a domain-specific gradient inversion attack named Grab (gradient inversion with hybrid optimization). Grab features two alternating optimization processes to address the challenges caused by practical training settings, including a simultaneous optimization on dropout masks between layers for improved token recovery and a discrete optimization for effective token sequencing. Grab can recover a significant portion (up to 92.9% recovery rate) of the private training data, outperforming the attack strategy of utilizing discrete optimization with an auxiliary model by notable improvements of up to 28.9% recovery rate in benchmark settings and 48.5% recovery rate in practical settings. Grab provides a valuable step forward in understanding this privacy threat in the emerging FL training mode of language models.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21199v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Interactive multimodal applications (IMAs), such as route planning in the Internet of Vehicles, enrich users' personalized experiences by integrating various forms of data over wireless networks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) utilize mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanisms to empower multiple IMAs, with each LLM trained individually for a specific task that presents different business workflows. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on multiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes various IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two primary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA objectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in resource-constrained mobile environments. To tackle the first challenge, we propose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich structured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph. We partition the learnable parameter matrix of neural layers for each IMA to facilitate LLM composition. Then, we develop a step-by-step fine-tuning procedure guided by task relations, including training, freezing, and masking phases. This allows the LLM to learn to reason among tasks for better adaptation, capturing the latent dependencies between tasks. For the second challenge, we introduce ContextGear, a scheduling strategy to optimize the training procedure of ContextLoRA, aiming to minimize computational and communication costs through a strategic grouping mechanism. Experiments on three benchmarks show the superiority of the proposed ContextLoRA and ContextGear. Furthermore, we prototype our proposed paradigm on a real-world wireless testbed, demonstrating its practical applicability for various IMAs. We will release our code to the community.",

To expand the use of deep models, it is essential to overcome the labor-intensive curation process by developing robust algorithms that can learn from diverse, real-world data distributions. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep Neural Networks which can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the real world.

The first part of the thesis focuses on Learning Generative Models from Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate the mode-collapse and enable diverse aesthetic image generations for tail (minority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective generalization on tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which allow tail classes to generalize as effectively as the head classes without requiring explicit generation of images.

Existing models require future input (e.g., bubble positions) during inference because they fail to learn nucleation from past states, limiting their ability to autonomously forecast boiling dynamics. They also fail to model flow boiling velocity fields, where sharp interface-momentum coupling demands long-range and directional inductive biases. We introduce Bubbleformer, a transformer-based spatiotemporal model that forecasts stable and long-range boiling dynamics including nucleation, interface evolution, and heat transfer without dependence on simulation data during inference. Bubbleformer integrates factorized axial attention, frequency-aware scaling, and conditions on thermophysical parameters to generalize across fluids, geometries, and operating conditions. To evaluate physical fidelity in chaotic systems, we propose interpretable physics-based metrics that evaluate heat-flux consistency, interface geometry, and mass conservation. We also release BubbleML 2.0, a high-fidelity dataset that spans diverse working fluids (cryogens, refrigerants, dielectrics), boiling configurations (pool and flow boiling), flow regimes (bubbly, slug, annular), and boundary conditions.

However, explaining/interpreting how these models integrate visual information, language information and knowledge representation to generate meaningful captions remains a challenging problem. Standard metrics to measure performance typically rely on comparing generated captions with human-written ones that may not provide a user with a deep insights into this integration. In this work, we develop a novel explanation framework that is easily interpretable based on Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) - a language that can combine symbolic rules with real-valued functions - where we hypothesize how relevant examples from the training data could have influenced the generation of the observed caption. To do this, we learn a HMLN distribution over the training instances and infer the shift in distributions over these instances when we condition on the generated sample which allows us to quantify which examples may have been a source of richer information to generate the observed caption. Our experiments on captions generated for several state-of-the-art captioning models using Amazon Mechanical Turk illustrate the interpretability of our explanations, and allow us to compare these models along the dimension of explainability.",

Simulating these materials, for instance using finite element methods, is often computationally demanding and slow. Worse, such methods can suffer from numerical artifacts called ``membrane locking'' that makes cloth appear artificially stiff. Here we propose a general framework, called Mass-Spring Net, for learning a simple yet efficient surrogate model that captures the effects of these complex materials using only motion observations. The cloth is discretized into a mass-spring network with unknown material parameters that are learned directly from the motion data, using a novel force-and-impulse loss function. Our approach demonstrates the ability to accurately model spatially varying material properties from a variety of data sources, and immunity to membrane locking which plagues FEM-based simulations.

Although large language models (LLMs) have enabled numerous automated pipelines for converting natural language into structured formats, there is still a lack of benchmarks for evaluating their extraction quality, especially in specific domains or focused documents specific to a given organization. Building such benchmarks by manual annotations is labour-intensive and limits the size and scalability of the benchmarks. In this work, we present StructText, an end-to-end framework for automatically generating high-fidelity benchmarks for key-value extraction from text using existing tabular data. It uses available tabular data as structured ground truth, and follows a two-stage ``plan-then-execute'' pipeline to synthetically generate corresponding natural-language text. To ensure alignment between text and structured source, we introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation strategy that combines (a) LLM-based judgments on factuality, hallucination, and coherence and (b) objective extraction metrics measuring numeric and temporal accuracy. We evaluated the proposed method on 71,539 examples across 49 datasets. Results reveal that while LLMs achieve strong factual accuracy and avoid hallucination, they struggle with narrative coherence in producing extractable text. Notably, models presume numerical and temporal information with high fidelity yet this information becomes embedded in narratives that resist automated extraction.

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21382v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Software architecture design is a critical, yet inherently complex and knowledge-intensive phase of software development. It requires deep domain expertise, development experience, architectural knowledge, careful trade-offs among competing quality attributes, and the ability to adapt to evolving requirements. Traditionally, this process is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and relies heavily on architects, often resulting in limited design alternatives, especially under the pressures of agile development. While Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promising performance across various SE tasks, their application to architecture design remains relatively scarce and requires more exploration, particularly in light of diverse domain knowledge and complex decision-making. To address the challenges, we proposed MAAD (Multi-Agent Architecture Design), an automated framework that employs a knowledge-driven Multi-Agent System (MAS) for architecture design. MAAD orchestrates four specialized agents (i.e., Analyst, Modeler, Designer and Evaluator) to collaboratively interpret requirements specifications and produce architectural blueprints enriched with quality attributes-based evaluation reports. We then evaluated MAAD through a case study and comparative experiments against MetaGPT, a state-of-the-art MAS baseline. Our results show that MAAD's superiority lies in generating comprehensive architectural components and delivering insightful and structured architecture evaluation reports. Feedback from industrial architects across 11 requirements specifications further reinforces MAAD's practical usability. We finally explored the performance of the MAAD framework with three LLMs (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and Llama 3.3) and found that GPT-4o exhibits better performance in producing architecture design, emphasizing the importance of LLM selection in MAS-driven architecture design.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21385v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: 3GPP Release 18 cell discontinuous transmission and reception (cell DTX/DRX) is an important new network energy saving feature for 5G. As a time-domain technique, it periodically aggregates the user data transmissions in a given duration of time when the traffic load is not heavy, so that the remaining time can be kept silent and advanced sleep modes (ASM) can be enabled to shut down more radio components and save more energy for the cell. However, inevitably the packet delay is increased, as during the silent period no transmission is allowed. In this paper we study how to configure cell DTX/DRX to optimally balance energy saving and packet delay, so that for delay-sensitive traffic maximum energy saving can be achieved while the degradation of quality of service (QoS) is minimized. As the optimal configuration can be different for different network and traffic conditions, the problem is complex and we resort to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to train an AI agent to solve it. Through careful design of 1) the learning algorithm, which implements a deep Q-network (DQN) on a contextual bandit (CB) model, and 2) the reward function, which utilizes a smooth approximation of a theoretically optimal but discontinuous reward function, we are able to train an AI agent that always tries to select the best possible Cell DTX/DRX configuration under any network and traffic conditions. Simulation results show that compared to the case when cell DTX/DRX is not used, our agent can achieve up to ~45% energy saving depending on the traffic load scenario, while always maintaining no more than ~1% QoS degradation.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21386v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Numerous Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) solvers have been proposed to address Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). However, most of these solvers focus exclusively on single-vehicle VRP variants, overlooking the more realistic min-max Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (MMHCVRP), which involves multiple vehicles. Existing MMHCVRP solvers typically select a vehicle and its next node to visit at each decoding step, but often make myopic decoding decisions and overlook key properties of MMHCVRP, including local topological relationships, vehicle permutation invariance, and node symmetry, resulting in suboptimal performance. To better address these limitations, we propose ECHO, an efficient NCO solver. First, ECHO exploits the proposed dual-modality node encoder to capture local topological relationships among nodes. Subsequently, to mitigate myopic decisions, ECHO employs the proposed Parameter-Free Cross-Attention mechanism to prioritize the vehicle selected in the preceding decoding step. Finally, leveraging vehicle permutation invariance and node symmetry, we introduce a tailored data augment strategy for MMHCVRP to stabilize the Reinforcement Learning training process. To assess the performance of ECHO, we conduct extensive experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that ECHO outperforms state-of-the-art NCO solvers across varying numbers of vehicles and nodes, and exhibits well-performing generalization across both scales and distribution patterns. Finally, ablation studies validate the effectiveness of all proposed methods.",

Existing MLLM-based approaches require instruction-following data for supervised fine-tuning and evaluate generation quality on analyzing text response, which is time-consuming and difficult to train. To address this problem, we propose LLaVA-Reward, which directly utilizes the hidden states of MLLMs given text-image pairs. To enhance the bidirectional interaction between visual and textual representations in decoder-only MLLMs, we further propose adding a Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module. This design enhances text-image correlation reasoning by connecting early-layer visual features with later-layer hidden representations.In addition, LLaVA-Reward supports different types of preference data for efficient fine-tuning, including paired preference data and unpaired data. We train LLaVA-Reward on four evaluation perspectives: text-image alignment, fidelity/artifact, safety, and overall ranking.

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21423v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Autonomous driving requires an understanding of the static environment from sensor data. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse multiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation from the latent BEV grid. However, traditional map construction models provide deterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent ambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane markings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages the diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized maps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries, MapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a BEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows aggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty estimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in single-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples consistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit of distribution modeling. Additionally, our uncertainty estimates are significantly higher in occluded areas, reinforcing their value in identifying regions with ambiguous sensor input. By modeling the full map distribution, MapDiffusion enhances the robustness and reliability of online vectorized HD map construction, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous vehicles in complex environments.",

We systematically benchmark eleven LLMs (1-12B parameters) across three stated and revealed preference datasets, testing 396 configurations and generating over 79,000 synthetic commuter predictions. Beyond predictive accuracy, we evaluate models generated reasoning using BERTopic for topic modelling and a novel Explanation Strength Index, providing the first structured analysis of how LLMs articulate decision factors in alignment with behavioural theory. LiTransMC, fine-tuned using parameter efficient and loss masking strategy, achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.6845 and a Jensen-Shannon Divergence of 0.000245, surpassing both untuned local models and larger proprietary systems, including GPT-4o with advanced persona inference and embedding-based loading, while also outperforming classical mode choice methods such as discrete choice models and machine learning classifiers for the same dataset. This dual improvement, i.e., high instant-level accuracy and near-perfect distributional calibration, demonstrates the feasibility of creating specialist, locally deployable LLMs that integrate prediction and interpretability.

Dataset Distillation becomes a popular technique recently to reduce the dataset size via learning a highly compact set of representative exemplars, where the model trained with these exemplars ideally should have comparable performance with respect to the one trained with the full dataset. While most of existing works upon dataset distillation focus on supervised datasets, we instead aim to distill images and their self-supervisedly trained representations into a distilled set. This procedure, named as Self-Supervised Dataset Distillation, effectively extracts rich information from real datasets, yielding the distilled sets with enhanced cross-architecture generalizability. Particularly, in order to preserve the key characteristics of original dataset more faithfully and compactly, several novel techniques are proposed: 1) we introduce an innovative parameterization upon images and representations via distinct low-dimensional bases, where the base selection for parameterization is experimentally shown to play a crucial role; 2) we tackle the instability induced by the randomness of data augmentation -- a key component in self-supervised learning but being underestimated in the prior work of self-supervised dataset distillation -- by utilizing predetermined augmentations; 3) we further leverage a lightweight network to model the connections among the representations of augmented views from the same image, leading to more compact pairs of distillation.

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21482v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, but developing high-performing models for specialized applications often requires substantial human annotation -- a process that is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. In this paper, we address the label-efficient learning problem for supervised finetuning (SFT) by leveraging task-diversity as a fundamental principle for effective data selection. This is markedly different from existing methods based on the prompt-diversity. Our approach is based on two key observations: 1) task labels for different prompts are often readily available; 2) pre-trained models have significantly varying levels of confidence across tasks. We combine these facts to devise a simple yet effective sampling strategy: we select examples across tasks using an inverse confidence weighting strategy. This produces models comparable to or better than those trained with more complex sampling procedures, while being significantly easier to implement and less computationally intensive. Notably, our experimental results demonstrate that this method can achieve better accuracy than training on the complete dataset (a 4\\% increase in MMLU score). Across various annotation budgets and two instruction finetuning datasets, our algorithm consistently performs at or above the level of the best existing methods, while reducing annotation costs by up to 80\\%.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21483v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Neural networks have received a lot of attention recently, and related security issues have come with it. Many studies have shown that neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples that have been artificially perturbed with modification, which is too small to be distinguishable by human perception. Different attacks and defenses have been proposed to solve these problems, but there is little research on evaluating the robustness of neural networks and their inputs. In this work, we propose a metric called the neuron cover change rate (NCCR) to measure the ability of deep learning models to resist attacks and the stability of adversarial examples. NCCR monitors alterations in the output of specifically chosen neurons when the input is perturbed, and networks with a smaller degree of variation are considered to be more robust. The results of the experiment on image recognition and the speaker recognition model show that our metrics can provide a good assessment of the robustness of neural networks or their inputs. It can also be used to detect whether an input is adversarial or not, as adversarial examples are always less robust.",

However, debugging HLS code is a challenging and labor-intensive task, especially for novice circuit designers or software engineers without sufficient hardware domain knowledge. The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is promising in automating the HLS debugging process. Despite the great potential, three key challenges persist when applying LLMs to HLS logic debugging: 1) High-quality circuit data for training LLMs is scarce, posing a significant challenge. 2) Debugging logic bugs in hardware is inherently more complex than identifying software bugs with existing golden test cases. 3) The absence of reliable test cases requires multi-tasking solutions, performing both bug identification and correction. complicates the multi-tasking required for effective HLS debugging. In this work, we propose a customized solution named HLSDebugger to address the challenges. HLSDebugger first generates and releases a large labeled dataset with 300K data samples, targeting HLS logic bugs. The HLSDebugger model adopts an encoder-decoder structure, performing bug location identification, bug type prediction, and bug correction with the same model.

As a result, implementing embedding models for recommendation and content control duties in applications is crucial. However, a lack of large-scale test datasets, both in volume and task diversity, makes it tricky for scientists to effectively evaluate AI models before deploying them in real-world, large-scale projects. To solve this important problem, we introduce a Vietnamese benchmark, VN-MTEB for embedding models, which we created by translating a large number of English samples from the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark using our new automated framework. We leverage the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and cutting-edge embedding models to conduct translation and filtering processes to retain high-quality samples, guaranteeing a natural flow of language and semantic fidelity while preserving named entity recognition (NER) and code snippets. Our comprehensive benchmark consists of 41 datasets from six tasks specifically designed for Vietnamese text embeddings. In our analysis, we find that bigger and more complex models using Rotary Positional Embedding outperform those using Absolute Positional Embedding in embedding tasks.

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21506v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: A drone trajectory planner should be able to dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off according to varying mission requirements in unknown environments. Although traditional polynomial-based planners offer computational efficiency and smooth trajectory generation, they require expert knowledge to tune multiple parameters to adjust this trade-off. Moreover, even with careful tuning, the resulting adjustment may fail to achieve the desired trade-off. Similarly, although reinforcement learning-based planners are adaptable in unknown environments, they do not explicitly address the safety-efficiency trade-off. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Decision Transformer-based trajectory planner that leverages a single parameter, Return-to-Go (RTG), as a \\emph{temperature parameter} to dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off. In our framework, since RTG intuitively measures the safety and efficiency of a trajectory, RTG tuning does not require expert knowledge. We validate our approach using Gazebo simulations in both structured grid and unstructured random environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our planner can dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off by simply tuning the RTG parameter. Furthermore, our planner outperforms existing baseline methods across various RTG settings, generating safer trajectories when tuned for safety and more efficient trajectories when tuned for efficiency. Real-world experiments further confirm the reliability and practicality of our proposed planner.",

The rapidly advancing realm of NLP is creating new opportunities for efficient, machine-assisted workflows, which can bring new perspectives and results to the forefront. Thus, we replicate and extend a previous NLP4RE study (baseline), \"Classifying User Requirements from Online Feedback in Small Dataset Environments using Deep Learning\", which evaluated different deep learning models for requirement classification from user reviews. We reproduced the original results using publicly released source code, thereby helping to strengthen the external validity of the baseline study. We then extended the setup by evaluating model performance on an external dataset and comparing results to a GPT-4o zero-shot classifier. Furthermore, we prepared the replication study ID-card for the baseline study, important for evaluating replication readiness. Results showed diverse reproducibility levels across different models, with Naive Bayes demonstrating perfect reproducibility. In contrast, BERT and other models showed mixed results. Our findings revealed that baseline deep learning models, BERT and ELMo, exhibited good generalization capabilities on an external dataset, and GPT-4o showed performance comparable to traditional baseline machine learning models.

Experimental results demonstrate that the developed approach performs well in uncovering quantization index modulation (QIM)-based steganographic patterns in VoIP signals. It achieves detection accuracy exceeding 98 percent even for short 0.5 second samples, and 95.17 percent accuracy under challenging conditions with low embedding rates, representing an improvement of 2.8 percent over the best performing state of the art methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits superior efficiency, with an average detection time as low as 0.016 seconds for 0.5-second samples an improvement of 0.003 seconds.

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21653v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Real-world fraud detection applications benefit from graph learning techniques that jointly exploit node features, often rich in textual data, and graph structural information. Recently, Graph-Enhanced LLMs emerge as a promising graph learning approach that converts graph information into prompts, exploiting LLMs' ability to reason over both textual and structural information. Among them, text-only prompting, which converts graph information to prompts consisting solely of text tokens, offers a solution that relies only on LLM tuning without requiring additional graph-specific encoders. However, text-only prompting struggles on heterogeneous fraud-detection graphs: multi-hop relations expand exponentially with each additional hop, leading to rapidly growing neighborhoods associated with dense textual information. These neighborhoods may overwhelm the model with long, irrelevant content in the prompt and suppress key signals from the target node, thereby degrading performance. To address this challenge, we propose Dual Granularity Prompting (DGP), which mitigates information overload by preserving fine-grained textual details for the target node while summarizing neighbor information into coarse-grained text prompts. DGP introduces tailored summarization strategies for different data modalities, bi-level semantic abstraction for textual fields and statistical aggregation for numerical features, enabling effective compression of verbose neighbor content into concise, informative prompts. Experiments across public and industrial datasets demonstrate that DGP operates within a manageable token budget while improving fraud detection performance by up to 6.8% (AUPRC) over state-of-the-art methods, showing the potential of Graph-Enhanced LLMs for fraud detection.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21690v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are generally trained at fixed resolutions, limiting their capability when scaling up to high-resolution images. While training-based approaches address this limitation by training on high-resolution datasets, they require large amounts of data and considerable computational resources, making them less practical. Consequently, training-free methods, particularly patch-based approaches, have become a popular alternative. These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the denoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution generation. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches, which we call ``patch-level distribution shift\" and ``increased patch monotonicity.\" To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT), a framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions remain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with the patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined details in high-resolution images. In addition, APT enables a shortcut denoising process, resulting in faster sampling with minimal quality degradation. Our experimental results confirm that APT produces more detailed outputs with improved inference speed, providing a practical approach to high-resolution image generation.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21723v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: In recent years, Explainable AI has gained traction as an approach to enhancing model interpretability and transparency, particularly in complex models such as detection transformers. Despite rapid advancements, a substantial research gap remains in understanding the distinct roles of internal components - knowledge that is essential for improving transparency and efficiency. Inspired by neuroscientific ablation studies, which investigate the functions of brain regions through selective impairment, we systematically analyze the impact of ablating key components in three state-of-the-art detection transformer models: Detection transformer (DETR), deformable detection transformer (DDETR), and DETR with improved denoising anchor boxes (DINO). The ablations target query embeddings, encoder and decoder multi-head self-attentions (MHSA) as well as decoder multi-head cross-attention (MHCA) layers. We evaluate the effects of these ablations on the performance metrics gIoU and F1-score, quantifying effects on both the classification and regression sub-tasks on the COCO dataset. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, we publicly release the DeepDissect library. Our findings reveal model-specific resilience patterns: while DETR is particularly sensitive to ablations in encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA, DDETR's multi-scale deformable attention enhances robustness, and DINO exhibits the greatest resilience due to its look-forward twice update rule, which helps distributing knowledge across blocks. These insights also expose structural redundancies, particularly in DDETR's and DINO's decoder MHCA layers, highlighting opportunities for model simplification without sacrificing performance. This study advances XAI for DETRs by clarifying the contributions of internal components to model performance, offering insights to optimize and improve transparency and efficiency in critical applications.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21738v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific samples from a trained model. A key challenge in this process is over-unlearning, where the model's performance on the remaining data significantly drops due to the change in the model's parameters. Existing unlearning algorithms depend on the remaining data to prevent this issue. As such, these methods are inapplicable in a more practical scenario, where only the unlearning samples are available (i.e., zero-shot unlearning). This paper presents a novel framework, ZS-PAG, to fill this gap. Our approach offers three key innovations: (1) we approximate the inaccessible remaining data by generating adversarial samples; (2) leveraging the generated samples, we pinpoint a specific subspace to perform the unlearning process, therefore preventing over-unlearning in the challenging zero-shot scenario; and (3) we consider the influence of the unlearning process on the remaining samples and design an influence-based pseudo-labeling strategy.

This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining high accuracy and low computational demands.

LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low latency.

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21790v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to support various workflows across different disciplines, yet their potential in choice modelling remains relatively unexplored. This work examines the potential of LLMs as assistive agents in the specification and, where technically feasible, estimation of Multinomial Logit models. We implement a systematic experimental framework involving thirteen versions of six leading LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Gemma, and Llama) evaluated under five experimental configurations. These configurations vary along three dimensions: modelling goal (suggesting vs. suggesting and estimating MNLs); prompting strategy (Zero-Shot vs. Chain-of-Thoughts); and information availability (full dataset vs. data dictionary only). Each LLM-suggested specification is implemented, estimated, and evaluated based on goodness-of-fit metrics, behavioural plausibility, and model complexity. Findings reveal that proprietary LLMs can generate valid and behaviourally sound utility specifications, particularly when guided by structured prompts. Open-weight models such as Llama and Gemma struggled to produce meaningful specifications. Claude 4 Sonnet consistently produced the best-fitting and most complex models, while GPT models suggested models with robust and stable modelling outcomes. Some LLMs performed better when provided with just data dictionary, suggesting that limiting raw data access may enhance internal reasoning capabilities. Among all LLMs, GPT o3 was uniquely capable of correctly estimating its own specifications by executing self-generated code. Overall, the results demonstrate both the promise and current limitations of LLMs as assistive agents in choice modelling, not only for model specification but also for supporting modelling decision and estimation, and provide practical guidance for integrating these tools into choice modellers' workflows.",

MoDeSuite consists of eight distinct mobile manipulation tasks covering both elastic objects and deformable objects, each presenting a unique challenge inspired by real-world robot applications. Success in these tasks requires effective collaboration between the robot's base and manipulator, as well as the ability to exploit the deformability of the objects. To evaluate and demonstrate the use of the proposed benchmark, we train two state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms and two imitation learning algorithms, highlighting the difficulties encountered and showing their performance in simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical relevance of the suite by deploying the trained policies directly into the real world with the Spot robot, showcasing the potential for sim-to-real transfer. We expect that MoDeSuite will open a novel research domain in mobile manipulation involving deformable objects. Find more details, code, and videos at https://sites.google.com/view/modesuite/home.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21799v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The empirical success of deep learning has spurred its application to the radio-frequency (RF) domain, leading to significant advances in Deep Wireless Sensing (DWS). However, most existing DWS models function as black boxes with limited interpretability, which hampers their generalizability and raises concerns in security-sensitive physical applications. In this work, inspired by the remarkable advances of white-box transformers, we present RF-CRATE, the first mathematically interpretable deep network architecture for RF sensing, grounded in the principles of complex sparse rate reduction. To accommodate the unique RF signals, we conduct non-trivial theoretical derivations that extend the original real-valued white-box transformer to the complex domain. By leveraging the CR-Calculus framework, we successfully construct a fully complex-valued white-box transformer with theoretically derived self-attention and residual multi-layer perceptron modules. Furthermore, to improve the model's ability to extract discriminative features from limited wireless data, we introduce Subspace Regularization, a novel regularization strategy that enhances feature diversity, resulting in an average performance improvement of 19.98% across multiple sensing tasks. We extensively evaluate RF-CRATE against seven baselines with multiple public and self-collected datasets involving different RF signals. The results show that RF-CRATE achieves performance on par with thoroughly engineered black-box models, while offering full mathematical interpretability. More importantly, by extending CRATE to the complex domain, RF-CRATE yields substantial improvements, achieving an average classification gain of 5.08% and reducing regression error by 10.34% across diverse sensing tasks compared to CRATE.

We present the first systematic effective-field-theory analysis of FNOs in an infinite-dimensional function space, deriving closed recursion relations for the layer kernel and four-point vertex and then examining three practically important settings-analytic activations, scale-invariant cases and architectures with residual connections. The theory shows that nonlinear activations inevitably couple frequency inputs to high-frequency modes that are otherwise discarded by spectral truncation, and experiments confirm this frequency transfer. For wide networks we obtain explicit criticality conditions on the weight-initialization ensemble that keep small input perturbations to have uniform scale across depth, and empirical tests validate these predictions. Taken together, our results quantify how nonlinearity enables neural operators to capture non-trivial features, supply criteria for hyper-parameter selection via criticality analysis, and explain why scale-invariant activations and residual connections enhance feature learning in FNOs.",

We argue against AGI Racing. First, the downsides of racing to AGI are much higher than portrayed by this view. Racing to AGI would substantially increase catastrophic risks from AI, including nuclear instability, and undermine the prospects of technical AI safety research to be effective. Second, the expected benefits of racing may be lower than proponents of AGI Racing hold. In particular, it is questionable whether winning the race enables complete domination over losers. Third, international cooperation and coordination, and perhaps carefully crafted deterrence measures, constitute viable alternatives to racing to AGI which have much smaller risks and promise to deliver most of the benefits that racing to AGI is supposed to provide.

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21890v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Quantum computation offers potential exponential speedups for simulating certain physical systems, but its application to nonlinear dynamics is inherently constrained by the requirement of unitary evolution. We propose the quantum Koopman method (QKM), a data-driven framework that bridges this gap through transforming nonlinear dynamics into linear unitary evolution in higher-dimensional observable spaces. Leveraging the Koopman operator theory to achieve a global linearization, our approach maps system states into a hierarchy of Hilbert spaces using a deep autoencoder. Within the linearized embedding spaces, the state representation is decomposed into modulus and phase components, and the evolution is governed by a set of unitary Koopman operators that act exclusively on the phase. These operators are constructed from diagonal Hamiltonians with coefficients learned from data, a structure designed for efficient implementation on quantum hardware. This architecture enables direct multi-step prediction, and the operator's computational complexity scales logarithmically with the observable space dimension. The QKM is validated across diverse nonlinear systems. Its predictions maintain relative errors below 6% for reaction-diffusion systems and shear flows, and capture key statistics in 2D turbulence. This work establishes a practical pathway for quantum-accelerated simulation of nonlinear phenomena, exploring a framework built on the synergy between deep learning for global linearization and quantum algorithms for unitary dynamics evolution.",

We conducted controlled experiments on five language models of varying sizes and architectures, training them to produce warmer, more empathetic responses, then evaluating them on safety-critical tasks. Warm models showed substantially higher error rates (+10 to +30 percentage points) than their original counterparts, promoting conspiracy theories, providing incorrect factual information, and offering problematic medical advice. They were also significantly more likely to validate incorrect user beliefs, particularly when user messages expressed sadness. Importantly, these effects were consistent across different model architectures, and occurred despite preserved performance on standard benchmarks, revealing systematic risks that current evaluation practices may fail to detect.

Among these applications, fundus image analysis presents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus diseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced prediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the Shifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) Attention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin Transformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and long-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is incorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature channels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to previous studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories, this work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby enhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye Disease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category classification. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\\% accuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90.

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21949v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Existing shadow removal methods often rely on shadow masks, which are challenging to acquire in real-world scenarios. Exploring intrinsic image cues, such as local contrast information, presents a potential alternative for guiding shadow removal in the absence of explicit masks. However, the cue's inherent ambiguity becomes a critical limitation in complex scenes, where it can fail to distinguish true shadows from low-reflectance objects and intricate background textures. To address this motivation, we propose the Adaptive Gated Dual-Branch Attention (AGBA) mechanism. AGBA dynamically filters and re-weighs the contrast prior to effectively disentangle shadow features from confounding visual elements. Furthermore, to tackle the persistent challenge of restoring soft shadow boundaries and fine-grained details, we introduce a diffusion-based Frequency-Contrast Fusion Network (FCFN) that leverages high-frequency and contrast cues to guide the generative process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results among mask-free approaches while maintaining competitive performance relative to mask-based methods.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.21954v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Multilingual programming, which involves using multiple programming languages (PLs) in a single project, is increasingly common due to its benefits. However, it introduces cross-language bugs (CLBs), which arise from interactions between different PLs and are difficult to detect by single-language bug detection tools. This paper investigates the potential of pre-trained code language models (CodeLMs) in CLB detection. We developed CLCFinder, a cross-language code identification tool, and constructed a CLB dataset involving three PL combinations (Python-C/C++, Java-C/C++, and Python-Java) with nine interaction types. We fine-tuned 13 CodeLMs on this dataset and evaluated their performance, analyzing the effects of dataset size, token sequence length, and code comments. Results show that all CodeLMs performed poorly before fine-tuning, but exhibited varying degrees of performance improvement after fine-tuning, with UniXcoder-base achieving the best F1 score (0.7407). Notably, small fine-tuned CodeLMs tended to performe better than large ones. CodeLMs fine-tuned on single-language bug datasets performed poorly on CLB detection, demonstrating the distinction between CLBs and single-language bugs. Additionally, increasing the fine-tuning dataset size significantly improved performance, while longer token sequences did not necessarily improve the model performance. The impact of code comments varied across models. Some fine-tuned CodeLMs' performance was improved, while others showed degraded performance.",

The trained student is then used to generate adversarial examples using FG, FGS, and PGD attacks, which are evaluated against a black-box target model (GoogLeNet). Our results show that student models distilled from multiple teachers achieve attack success rates comparable to ensemble-based baselines, while reducing adversarial example generation time by up to a factor of six. An ablation study further reveals that lower temperature settings and the inclusion of hard-label supervision significantly enhance transferability.

Unlike existing methods, our algorithms can be used to stain and lock pre-trained models without requiring fine-tuning or retraining, and come with provable, computable guarantees bounding their worst-case false positive rates. The stain and lock are implemented by directly modifying a small number of the model's weights and have minimal impact on the (unlocked) model's performance.

We introduce CEDANet, a human-in-the-loop, class-aware domain adaptation framework that uniquely integrates weak, citizen-provided video-level labels with adversarial feature alignment. Specifically, we refine pseudo-labels generated by a source-trained segmentation model using citizen votes, and employ class-specific domain discriminators to transfer rich source-domain representations to the industrial domain. Comprehensive experiments on SMOKE5K and custom IJmond datasets demonstrate that CEDANet achieves an F1-score of 0.414 and a smoke-class IoU of 0.261 with citizen feedback, vastly outperforming the baseline model, which scored 0.083 and 0.043 respectively. This represents a five-fold increase in F1-score and a six-fold increase in smoke-class IoU. Notably, CEDANet with citizen-constrained pseudo-labels achieves performance comparable to the same architecture trained on limited 100 fully annotated images with F1-score of 0.418 and IoU of 0.264, demonstrating its ability to reach small-sampled fully supervised-level accuracy without target-domain annotations.

Specifically, we investigate how a transformer-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) model embeds visual inputs in a simple environment where an agent must collect \"coins\" while avoiding dynamic obstacles consisting of \"spotlights.\" By adapting Robinson et al.'s study of the volume growth transform for LLMs to the RL setting, we find that the token embedding space for our visual coin collecting game is also not a manifold, and is better modeled as a stratified space, where local dimension can vary from point to point. We further strengthen Robinson's method by proving that fairly general volume growth curves can be realized by stratified spaces. Finally, we carry out an analysis that suggests that as an RL agent acts, its latent representation alternates between periods of low local dimension, while following a fixed sub-strategy, and bursts of high local dimension, where the agent achieves a sub-goal (e.g., collecting an object) or where the environmental complexity increases (e.g., more obstacles appear). Consequently, our work suggests that the distribution of dimensions in a stratified latent space may provide a new geometric indicator of complexity for RL games.",

As one building block of this method, we propose a novel point-shifting mechanism to introduce perturbations in point cloud data. Recently, AI has seen an exponential growth. Hence, it is important to understand the decision-making process of AI algorithms when they are applied in critical areas. Our work focuses on explaining AI algorithms that classify point cloud data. An important aspect of the methods used for explaining AI algorithms is their ability to produce explanations that are easy for humans to understand. This allows them to analyze the AI algorithms better and make appropriate decisions based on that analysis. Therefore, in this work, we intend to generate meaningful explanations that can be easily interpreted by humans. The point cloud data we consider represents 3D objects such as cars, guitars, and laptops. We make use of point cloud segmentation models to generate explanations for the working of classification models. The segments are used to introduce perturbations into the input point cloud data and generate saliency maps. The perturbations are introduced using the novel point-shifting mechanism proposed in this work which ensures that the shifted points no longer influence the output of the classification algorithm. In contrast to previous methods, the segments used by our method are meaningful, i.e. humans can easily interpret the meaning of the segments. Thus, the benefit of our method over other methods is its ability to produce more meaningful saliency maps.

      "description": "arXiv:2507.22037v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has led to breakthroughs in various applications, yet their security remains a critical challenge. One pressing issue involves unsafe image-query pairs--jailbreak inputs specifically designed to bypass security constraints and elicit unintended responses from MLLMs. Compared to general multimodal data, such unsafe inputs are relatively sparse, which limits the diversity and richness of training samples available for developing robust defense models. Meanwhile, existing guardrail-type methods rely on external modules to enforce security constraints but fail to address intrinsic vulnerabilities within MLLMs. Traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), on the other hand, often over-refuses harmless inputs, compromising general performance. Given these challenges, we propose Secure Tug-of-War (SecTOW), an innovative iterative defense-attack training method to enhance the security of MLLMs. SecTOW consists of two modules: a defender and an auxiliary attacker, both trained iteratively using reinforcement learning (GRPO). During the iterative process, the attacker identifies security vulnerabilities in the defense model and expands jailbreak data. The expanded data are then used to train the defender, enabling it to address identified security vulnerabilities. We also design reward mechanisms used for GRPO to simplify the use of response labels, reducing dependence on complex generative labels and enabling the efficient use of synthetic data. Additionally, a quality monitoring mechanism is used to mitigate the defender's over-refusal of harmless inputs and ensure the diversity of the jailbreak data generated by the attacker. Experimental results on safety-specific and general benchmarks demonstrate that SecTOW significantly improves security while preserving general performance.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.22053v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Accurate demand forecasting is critical for supply chain optimization, yet remains difficult in practice due to hierarchical complexity, domain shifts, and evolving external factors. While recent foundation models offer strong potential for time series forecasting, they often suffer from architectural rigidity and limited robustness under distributional change. In this paper, we propose a unified ensemble framework that enhances the performance of foundation models for sales forecasting in real-world supply chains. Our method combines two complementary strategies: (1) Hierarchical Ensemble (HE), which partitions training and inference by semantic levels (e.g., store, category, department) to capture localized patterns; and (2) Architectural Ensemble (AE), which integrates predictions from diverse model backbones to mitigate bias and improve stability. We conduct extensive experiments on the M5 benchmark and three external sales datasets, covering both in-domain and zero-shot forecasting. Results show that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines, improves accuracy across hierarchical levels, and provides a simple yet effective mechanism for boosting generalization in complex forecasting environments.",

STRATEGIST is a generalizable framework to optimize the strategy through population-based self-play simulations without the need for any training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of STRATEGIST in learning optimal strategies for competitive, multi-turn games with partial information, including Game of Pure Strategy (GOPS) and multi-agent, hidden-identity discussion games like The Resistance: Avalon.

Recent work like Curriculum-DPO integrates multiple pairs using a one-dimensional difficulty curriculum based on pairwise distinguishability (PD), but overlooks the complexity of the input prompt itself. To address this, we propose 2D-Curri-DPO, a novel framework employing a two-dimensional curriculum that jointly models Prompt Complexity (PC) and Pairwise Distinguishability. This framework introduces dual difficulty metrics to quantify prompt semantic complexity and response preference clarity, defines a curriculum strategy space encompassing multiple selectable strategies for task adaptation, and incorporates a KL-divergence-based adaptive mechanism for dynamic reference model updates to enhance training stability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that 2D-Curri-DPO significantly outperforms standard DPO and prior curriculum methods across multiple benchmarks, including MT-Bench, Vicuna Bench, and WizardLM. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging test sets like UltraFeedback. Ablation studies confirm the benefits of the 2D structure and adaptive mechanisms, while analysis provides guidance for strategy selection.

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to automate this process by generating questions in response to prompts, yet the effectiveness of LLM-generated retrieval practice on student learning remains to be established. In this study, we conducted an empirical study involving two college-level data science courses, with approximately 60 students. We compared learning outcomes during one week in which students received LLM-generated multiple-choice retrieval practice questions to those from a week in which no such questions were provided. Results indicate that students exposed to LLM-generated retrieval practice achieved significantly higher knowledge retention, with an average accuracy of 89%, compared to 73% in the week without such practice. These findings suggest that LLM-generated retrieval questions can effectively support student learning and may provide a scalable solution for integrating retrieval practice into real-time teaching.

We propose a framework, inspired by open-ended evolutionary theory, to reconsider these three \"dogmas.\" We revisit each assumption and address related concerns raised alongside them. To make our arguments relevant to RL as a model of biological learning, we first establish that evolutionary dynamics can plausibly operate within living brains over an individual's lifetime, and are not confined to cross-generational processes. We begin by revisiting the second dogma, drawing on evolutionary insights to enrich the \"adaptation-rather-than-search\" view of learning. We then address the third dogma regarding the limits of the reward hypothesis, using analogies from evolutionary fitness to illuminate the scalar reward vs. multi-objective debate. After discussing practical implications for exploration in RL, we turn to the first--and arguably most fundamental--issue: the absence of a formal account of agency. We argue that unlike the other two problems, the evolutionary paradigm alone cannot resolve the agency question, though it gestures in a productive direction. We advocate integrating ideas from origins-of-life theory, where the thermodynamics of sustenance and replication offer promising foundations for understanding agency and resource-constrained reinforcement learning in biological systems.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.19960v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: While it seems sensible that human-centred artificial intelligence (AI) means centring \"human behaviour and experience,\" it cannot be any other way. AI, I argue, is usefully seen as a relationship between technology and humans where it appears that artifacts can perform, to a greater or lesser extent, human cognitive labour. This is evinced using examples that juxtapose technology with cognition, inter alia: abacus versus mental arithmetic; alarm clock versus knocker-upper; camera versus vision; and sweatshop versus tailor. Using novel definitions and analyses, sociotechnical relationships can be analysed into varying types of: displacement (harmful), enhancement (beneficial), and/or replacement (neutral) of human cognitive labour. Ultimately, all AI implicates human cognition; no matter what. Obfuscation of cognition in the AI context -- from clocks to artificial neural networks -- results in distortion, in slowing critical engagement, perverting cognitive science, and indeed in limiting our ability to truly centre humans and humanity in the engineering of AI systems. To even begin to de-fetishise AI, we must look the human-in-the-loop in the eyes.",

Automatic extraction of chemical information from the literature is essential for constructing reaction databases, but it is currently limited by the multimodality and style variability of chemical information. In this work, we developed a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based multi-agent system for robust and automated chemical information extraction. It utilizes the MLLM's strong reasoning capability to understand the structure of diverse chemical graphics, decompose the extraction task into sub-tasks, and coordinate a set of specialized agents, each combining the capabilities of the MLLM with the precise, domain-specific strengths of dedicated tools, to solve them accurately and integrate the results into a unified output. Our system achieved an F1 score of 80.8% on a benchmark dataset of sophisticated multimodal chemical reaction graphics from the literature, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model (F1 score of 35.6%) by a significant margin. Additionally, it demonstrated consistent improvements in key sub-tasks, including molecular image recognition, reaction image parsing, named entity recognition and text-based reaction extraction.

We crystallize this emerging concern and correct popular misconceptions surrounding it, and advocate a simple multi-token objective.\n  As a starting point, we argue that the two often-conflated phases of next-token prediction -- autoregressive inference and teacher-forced training -- must be treated distinctly. The popular criticism that errors can compound during autoregressive inference, crucially assumes that teacher-forcing has learned an accurate next-token predictor. This assumption sidesteps a more deep-rooted problem we expose: in certain classes of tasks, teacher-forcing can simply fail to learn an accurate next-token predictor in the first place. We describe a general mechanism of how teacher-forcing can fail, and design a minimal planning task where both the Transformer and the Mamba architecture empirically fail in that manner -- remarkably, despite the task being straightforward to learn.\n  Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that this failure can be resolved using _teacherless_ training, a simple modification using dummy tokens that predicts multiple tokens in advance. We hope this finding can ground future debates and inspire explorations beyond the next-token prediction paradigm.

      "description": "arXiv:2407.15549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) can often be made to behave in undesirable ways that they are explicitly fine-tuned not to. For example, the LLM red-teaming literature has produced a wide variety of 'jailbreaking' techniques to elicit harmful text from models that were fine-tuned to be harmless. Recent work on red-teaming, model editing, and interpretability suggests that this challenge stems from how (adversarial) fine-tuning largely serves to suppress rather than remove undesirable capabilities from LLMs. Prior work has introduced latent adversarial training (LAT) as a way to improve robustness to broad classes of failures. These prior works have considered untargeted latent space attacks where the adversary perturbs latent activations to maximize loss on examples of desirable behavior. Untargeted LAT can provide a generic type of robustness but does not leverage information about specific failure modes. Here, we experiment with targeted LAT where the adversary seeks to minimize loss on a specific competing task. We find that it can augment a wide variety of state-of-the-art methods. First, we use targeted LAT to improve robustness to jailbreaks, outperforming a strong R2D2 baseline with orders of magnitude less compute. Second, we use it to more effectively remove backdoors with no knowledge of the trigger. Finally, we use it to more effectively unlearn knowledge for specific undesirable tasks in a way that is also more robust to re-learning.

These conventional methods typically suffer from reliance on large training datasets or lack a formalized language for precise edits. Utilizing CGA as a robust formal language, our system, Shenlong, precisely models spatial transformations necessary for accurate object repositioning. Leveraging the zero-shot learning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs, Shenlong translates natural language instructions into CGA operations which are then applied to the scene, facilitating exact spatial transformations within 3D scenes without the need for specialized pre-training. Implemented in a realistic simulation environment, Shenlong ensures compatibility with existing graphics pipelines. To accurately assess the impact of CGA, we benchmark against robust Euclidean Space baselines, evaluating both latency and accuracy. Comparative performance evaluations indicate that Shenlong significantly reduces LLM response times by 16% and boosts success rates by 9.6% on average compared to the traditional methods. Notably, Shenlong achieves a 100% perfect success rate in common practical queries, a benchmark where other systems fall short.

      "description": "arXiv:2409.18084v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: With the increasing presence of service robots and autonomous vehicles in human environments, navigation systems need to evolve beyond simple destination reach to incorporate social awareness. This paper introduces GSON, a novel group-based social navigation framework that leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to enhance robots' social perception capabilities. Our approach uses visual prompting to enable zero-shot extraction of social relationships among pedestrians and integrates these results with robust pedestrian detection and tracking pipelines to overcome the inherent inference speed limitations of LMMs. The planning system incorporates a mid-level planner that sits between global path planning and local motion planning, effectively preserving both global context and reactive responsiveness while avoiding disruption of the predicted social group. We validate GSON through extensive real-world mobile robot navigation experiments involving complex social scenarios such as queuing, conversations, and photo sessions. Comparative results show that our system significantly outperforms existing navigation approaches in minimizing social perturbations while maintaining comparable performance on traditional navigation metrics.",

      "description": "arXiv:2410.12342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Most knowledge distillation (KD) methodologies predominantly focus on teacher-student pairs with similar architectures, such as both being convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, the potential and flexibility of KD can be greatly improved by expanding it to novel Cross-Architecture KD (CAKD), where the knowledge of homogeneous and heterogeneous teachers can be transferred flexibly to a given student. The primary challenge in CAKD lies in the substantial feature gaps between heterogeneous models, originating from the distinction of their inherent inductive biases and module functions. To this end, we introduce an assistant model as a bridge to facilitate smooth feature knowledge transfer between heterogeneous teachers and students. More importantly, within our proposed design principle, the assistant model combines the advantages of cross-architecture inductive biases and module functions by merging convolution and attention modules derived from both student and teacher module functions. Furthermore, we observe that heterogeneous features exhibit diverse spatial distributions in CAKD, hindering the effectiveness of conventional pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) loss. Therefore, we leverage a spatial-agnostic InfoNCE loss to align features after spatial smoothing, thereby improving the feature alignments in CAKD. Our proposed method is evaluated across some homogeneous model pairs and arbitrary heterogeneous combinations of CNNs, ViTs, and MLPs, achieving state-of-the-art performance for distilled models with a maximum gain of 11.47% on CIFAR-100 and 3.67% on ImageNet-1K.

      "description": "arXiv:2411.17489v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Modern reconstruction techniques can effectively model complex 3D scenes from sparse 2D views. However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views and identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images and the limitations of no-reference image metrics in predicting reliable artifact maps. The absence of such metrics hinders assessment of the quality of novel views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. To tackle this, recent work has established a new category of metrics (cross-reference), predicting image quality solely by leveraging context from alternate viewpoint captures (arXiv:2404.14409). In this work, we propose a new cross-reference metric, Puzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our approach utilizes image patch statistics from the training views to establish a scene-specific distribution, later used to identify poorly reconstructed regions in the novel views. Given the lack of good measures to evaluate cross-reference methods in the context of 3D reconstruction, we collected a novel human-labeled dataset of artifact and distortion maps in unseen reconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art localization of artifacts in novel views, correlating with human assessment, even without aligned references. We can leverage our new metric to enhance applications like automatic image restoration, guided acquisition, or 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.

      "description": "arXiv:2412.03248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled the creation of multi-modal LLMs that exhibit strong comprehension of visual data such as images and videos.

In this work, we propose a training-free adaptive inference method for multi-modal LLMs that can accommodate a broad range of efficiency requirements with a minimum performance drop. Our method consists of a) iterative token merging based on embedding similarity before LLMs, and b) progressive token pruning within LLM layers based on multi-modal importance. With a minimalist design, our method can be applied to both video and image LLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse video and image benchmarks demonstrate that our method substantially reduces computation load (e.g., a $\\textbf{7-fold}$ reduction in FLOPs) while preserving the performance of video and image LLMs. Further, at a similar computational cost, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in long video understanding (e.g., $\\textbf{+4.6}$ on MLVU). Additionally, our in-depth analysis provides insights into token redundancy and LLM layer behaviors, offering guidance for future research in designing efficient multi-modal LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/LaVi-Lab/AIM.",

However, maintaining temporal consistency and motion alignment still remains challenging. To address these issues, this paper proposes DINO-guided Video Editing (DIVE), a framework designed to facilitate subject-driven editing in source videos conditioned on either target text prompts or reference images with specific identities. The core of DIVE lies in leveraging the powerful semantic features extracted from a pretrained DINOv2 model as implicit correspondences to guide the editing process. Specifically, to ensure temporal motion consistency, DIVE employs DINO features to align with the motion trajectory of the source video. For precise subject editing, DIVE incorporates the DINO features of reference images into a pretrained text-to-image model to learn Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRAs), effectively registering the target subject's identity. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world videos demonstrate that our framework can achieve high-quality editing results with robust motion consistency, highlighting the potential of DINO to contribute to video editing.

      "description": "arXiv:2502.05130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: This paper introduces Swap Forward (SaFa), a modality-agnostic and efficient method to generate seamless and coherence long spectrum and panorama through latent swap joint diffusion across multi-views. We first investigate the spectrum aliasing problem in spectrum-based audio generation caused by existing joint diffusion methods. Through a comparative analysis of the VAE latent representation of Mel-spectra and RGB images, we identify that the failure arises from excessive suppression of high-frequency components during the spectrum denoising process due to the averaging operator. To address this issue, we propose Self-Loop Latent Swap, a frame-level bidirectional swap applied to the overlapping region of adjacent views. Leveraging stepwise differentiated trajectories of adjacent subviews, this swap operator adaptively enhances high-frequency components and avoid spectrum distortion. Furthermore, to improve global cross-view consistency in non-overlapping regions, we introduce Reference-Guided Latent Swap, a unidirectional latent swap operator that provides a centralized reference trajectory to synchronize subview diffusions. By refining swap timing and intervals, we can achieve a cross-view similarity-diversity balance in a forward-only manner. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that SaFa significantly outperforms existing joint diffusion methods and even training-based methods in audio generation using both U-Net and DiT models, along with effective longer length adaptation. It also adapts well to panorama generation, achieving comparable performance with 2 $\\sim$ 20 $\\times$ faster speed and greater model generalizability.

      "description": "arXiv:2502.12207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains. However, they are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which can lead to erroneous predictions. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can leverage the generators and discriminators model to quickly produce high-quality adversarial examples. Since both modules train in a competitive and simultaneous manner, GAN-based algorithms like AdvGAN can generate adversarial examples with better transferability compared to traditional methods. However, the generation of perturbations is usually limited to a single iteration, preventing these examples from fully exploiting the potential of the methods. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel approach named Progressive Auto-Regression AdvGAN (PAR-AdvGAN). It incorporates an auto-regressive iteration mechanism within a progressive generation network to craft adversarial examples with enhanced attack capability. We thoroughly evaluate our PAR-AdvGAN method with a large-scale experiment, demonstrating its superior performance over various state-of-the-art black-box adversarial attacks, as well as the original AdvGAN.Moreover, PAR-AdvGAN significantly accelerates the adversarial example generation, i.e., achieving the speeds of up to 335.5 frames per second on Inception-v3 model, outperforming the gradient-based transferable attack algorithms.

Additionally, we employ collaborative learning with a dynamic consistency weight constraint to produce more robust representations. In the decoder stage, cross-attention is utilized to seamlessly integrate tabular data with corresponding label features. This dual-attention mechanism effectively captures both intra-instance and inter-instance interactions.

      "description": "arXiv:2502.16299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The accurate representation of epistemic uncertainty is a challenging yet essential task in machine learning. A widely used representation corresponds to convex sets of probabilistic predictors, also known as credal sets. One popular way of constructing these credal sets is via ensembling or specialized supervised learning methods, where the epistemic uncertainty can be quantified through measures such as the set size or the disagreement among members. In principle, these sets should contain the true data-generating distribution. As a necessary condition for this validity, we adopt the strongest notion of calibration as a proxy. Concretely, we propose a novel statistical test to determine whether there is a convex combination of the set's predictions that is calibrated in distribution. In contrast to previous methods, our framework allows the convex combination to be instance dependent, recognizing that different ensemble members may be better calibrated in different regions of the input space. Moreover, we learn this combination via proper scoring rules, which inherently optimize for calibration. Building on differentiable, kernel-based estimators of calibration errors, we introduce a nonparametric testing procedure and demonstrate the benefits of capturing instance-level variability on of synthetic and real-world experiments.",

It reduces redundant computation at the cost of increased memory usage. To mitigate this overhead, existing approaches compress KV tensors into lower-bit representations; however, quantization errors can accumulate as more tokens are generated, potentially resulting in undesired outputs. In this paper, we introduce SQuat (Subspace-orthogonal KV cache quantization). It first constructs a subspace spanned by query tensors to capture the most critical task-related information. During key tensor quantization, it enforces that the difference between the (de)quantized and original keys remains orthogonal to this subspace, minimizing the impact of quantization errors on the attention mechanism's outputs. SQuat requires no model fine-tuning, no additional calibration dataset for offline learning, and is grounded in a theoretical framework we develop.

This opinion paper argues that trust in AI isn't a simple transfer from humans to machines - it is a dynamic, evolving relationship that must be built and maintained. Rather than debating whether AI belongs in medicine, it asks: what kind of trust must AI earn, and how? Drawing from philosophy, bioethics, and system design, it explores the key differences between human trust and machine reliability - emphasizing transparency, accountability, and alignment with the values of good care. It argues that trust in AI should not be built on mimicking empathy or intuition, but on thoughtful design, responsible deployment, and clear moral responsibility.

      "description": "arXiv:2504.10541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The burgeoning presence of Large Language Models (LLM) is propelling the development of personalized recommender systems. Most existing LLM-based methods fail to sufficiently explore the multi-view graph structure correlations inherent in recommendation scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel framework, Hypergraph Enhanced LLM Learning for multimodal Recommendation (HeLLM), designed to equip LLMs with the capability to capture intricate higher-order semantic correlations by fusing graph-level contextual signals with sequence-level behavioral patterns. In the recommender pre-training phase, we design a user hypergraph to uncover shared interest preferences among users and an item hypergraph to capture correlations within multimodal similarities among items. The hypergraph convolution and synergistic contrastive learning mechanism are introduced to enhance the distinguishability of learned representations. In the LLM fine-tuning phase, we inject the learned graph-structured embeddings directly into the LLM's architecture and integrate sequential features capturing each user's chronological behavior. This process enables hypergraphs to leverage graph-structured information as global context, enhancing the LLM's ability to perceive complex relational patterns and integrate multimodal information, while also modeling local temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines, confirming the advantages of fusing hypergraph-based context with sequential user behavior in LLMs for recommendation.",

      "description": "arXiv:2505.10774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Time series forecasting is important for applications spanning energy markets, climate analysis, and traffic management. However, existing methods struggle to effectively integrate exogenous texts and align them with the probabilistic nature of large language models (LLMs). Current approaches either employ shallow text-time series fusion via basic prompts or rely on deterministic numerical decoding that conflict with LLMs' token-generation paradigm, which limits contextual awareness and distribution modeling. To address these limitations, we propose CAPTime, a context-aware probabilistic multimodal time series forecasting method that leverages text-informed abstraction and autoregressive LLM decoding. Our method first encodes temporal patterns using a pretrained time series encoder, then aligns them with textual contexts via learnable interactions to produce joint multimodal representations. By combining a mixture of distribution experts with frozen LLMs, we enable context-aware probabilistic forecasting while preserving LLMs' inherent distribution modeling capabilities. Experiments on diverse time series forecasting tasks demonstrate the superior accuracy and generalization of CAPTime, particularly in multimodal scenarios. Additional analysis highlights its robustness in data-scarce scenarios through hybrid probabilistic decoding.",

In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework for preference-based Multi-Objective Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MO-IRL), where human preferences are modeled as latent vector-valued reward functions. We formalize the problem of recovering a Pareto-optimal reward representation from noisy preference queries and establish conditions for identifying the underlying multi-objective structure. We derive tight sample complexity bounds for recovering $\\epsilon$-approximations of the Pareto front and introduce a regret formulation to quantify suboptimality in this multi-objective setting. Furthermore, we propose a provably convergent algorithm for policy optimization using preference-inferred reward cones.

To address this, we propose Forward-Backward RAG (FB-RAG), a new training-free framework based on a simple yet powerful forward-looking strategy. FB-RAG employs a light-weight LLM to peek into potential future generations, using evidence from multiple sampled outputs to precisely identify the most relevant context for a final, more powerful generator. This improves performance without complex finetuning or Reinforcement Learning common in prior work. Across 9 datasets, FB-RAG consistently delivers strong results. Further, the performance gains can be achieved with reduced latency due to a shorter, more focused prompt for the powerful generator. On EN.QA dataset, FB-RAG matches the leading baseline with over 48% latency reduction or achieves an 8% performance improvement with a 10% latency reduction. Our analysis finds cases where even when the forward-looking LLM fails to generate correct answers, its attempts are sufficient to guide the final model to an accurate response, demonstrating how smaller LLMs can systematically improve the performance and efficiency of larger ones.",

One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose RAIF, a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM.

      "description": "arXiv:2506.10978v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality. Building on this insight, we propose \"HeadHunter\", a systematic framework for iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives, enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1, demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and style-specific guidance.

      "description": "arXiv:2506.20031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Operations in disaster response, search \\& rescue, and military missions that involve multiple agents demand automated processes to support the planning of the courses of action (COA). Moreover, traverse-affecting changes in the environment (rain, snow, blockades, etc.) may impact the expected performance of a COA, making it desirable to have a pool of COAs that are diverse in task distributions across agents. Further, variations in agent capabilities, which could be human crews and/or autonomous systems, present practical opportunities and computational challenges to the planning process. This paper presents a new theoretical formulation and computational framework to generate such diverse pools of COAs for operations with soft variations in agent-task compatibility. Key to the problem formulation is a graph abstraction of the task space and the pool of COAs itself to quantify its diversity. Formulating the COAs as a centralized multi-robot task allocation problem, a genetic algorithm is used for (order-ignoring) allocations of tasks to each agent that jointly maximize diversity within the COA pool and overall compatibility of the agent-task mappings. A graph neural network is trained using a policy gradient approach to then perform single agent task sequencing in each COA, which maximizes completion rates adaptive to task features. Our tests of the COA generation process in a simulated environment demonstrate significant performance gain over a random walk baseline, small optimality gap in task sequencing, and execution time of about 50 minutes to plan up to 20 COAs for 5 agent/100 task operations.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.00090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Allocation of personnel and material resources is highly sensible in the case of firefighter interventions. This allocation relies on simulations to experiment with various scenarios. The main objective of this allocation is the global optimization of the firefighters response. Data generation is then mandatory to study various scenarios In this study, we propose to compare different data generation methods. Methods such as Random Sampling, Tabular Variational Autoencoders, standard Generative Adversarial Networks, Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Probabilistic Models are examined to ascertain their efficacy in capturing the intricacies of firefighter interventions. Traditional evaluation metrics often fall short in capturing the nuanced requirements of synthetic datasets for real-world scenarios. To address this gap, an evaluation of synthetic data quality is conducted using a combination of domain-specific metrics tailored to the firefighting domain and standard measures such as the Wasserstein distance. Domain-specific metrics include response time distribution, spatial-temporal distribution of interventions, and accidents representation. These metrics are designed to assess data variability, the preservation of fine and complex correlations and anomalies such as event with a very low occurrence, the conformity with the initial statistical distribution and the operational relevance of the synthetic data. The distribution has the particularity of being highly unbalanced, none of the variables following a Gaussian distribution, adding complexity to the data generation process.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.01918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We develop a rotation-invariant neural network that provides the global minimum-variance portfolio by jointly learning how to lag-transform historical returns and how to regularise both the eigenvalues and the marginal volatilities of large equity covariance matrices. This explicit mathematical mapping offers clear interpretability of each module's role, so the model cannot be regarded as a pure black-box. The architecture mirrors the analytical form of the global minimum-variance solution yet remains agnostic to dimension, so a single model can be calibrated on panels of a few hundred stocks and applied, without retraining, to one thousand US equities-a cross-sectional jump that demonstrates robust out-of-sample generalisation. The loss function is the future realized minimum portfolio variance and is optimized end-to-end on real daily returns. In out-of-sample tests from January 2000 to December 2024 the estimator delivers systematically lower realised volatility, smaller maximum drawdowns, and higher Sharpe ratios than the best analytical competitors, including state-of-the-art non-linear shrinkage. Furthermore, although the model is trained end-to-end to produce an unconstrained (long-short) minimum-variance portfolio, we show that its learned covariance representation can be used in general optimizers under long-only constraints with virtually no loss in its performance advantage over competing estimators. These gains persist when the strategy is executed under a highly realistic implementation framework that models market orders at the auctions, empirical slippage, exchange fees, and financing charges for leverage, and they remain stable during episodes of acute market stress.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.05714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a fundamental paradigm for addressing the challenges faced by large language models in handling real-time information and domain-specific problems. Traditional RAG systems primarily rely on the in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of the large language model itself. Still, in-depth research on the specific capabilities needed by the RAG generation model is lacking, leading to challenges with inconsistent document quality and retrieval system imperfections. Even the limited studies that fine-tune RAG generative models often \\textit{lack a granular focus on RAG task} or \\textit{a deeper utilization of chain-of-thought processes}. To address this, we propose that RAG models should possess three progressively hierarchical abilities (1) Filtering: the ability to select relevant information; (2) Combination: the ability to combine semantic information across paragraphs; and (3) RAG-specific reasoning: the ability to further process external knowledge using internal knowledge. Thus, we introduce our new RAG instruction fine-tuning method, Hierarchical-Thought Instruction-Tuning Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HIRAG) incorporates a \"think before answering\" strategy. This method enhances the model's open-book examination capability by utilizing multi-level progressive chain-of-thought. Experiments show that the HIRAG training strategy significantly improves the model's performance on datasets such as RGB, PopQA, MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and PubmedQA.",

The results were twofold and surprising. First, the detection precision obtained on the area of interest increased sensibly: in particular, the Intersection over Union (IoU) values, at the image segmentation level, surpassed 85 percent, while the general accuracy in detecting archeological sites reached 90 percent. Second, our retrained model allowed the identification of four new sites of archaeological interest (confirmed through field verification), previously not identified by archaeologists with traditional techniques.

While recent research has primarily focused on using LLMs to classify text as either human-written and machine-generated texts, our study focus on characterizing these texts using a set of linguistic features across different linguistic levels such as morphology, syntax, and semantics. We select a dataset of human-written and machine-generated texts spanning 8 domains and produced by 11 different LLMs. We calculate different linguistic features such as dependency length and emotionality and we use them for characterizing human-written and machine-generated texts along with different sampling strategies, repetition controls and model release date. Our statistical analysis reveals that human-written texts tend to exhibit simpler syntactic structures and more diverse semantic content. Furthermore, we calculate the variability of our set of features across models and domains. Both human and machine texts show stylistic diversity across domains, with humans displaying greater variation in our features. Finally, we apply style embeddings to further test variability among human-written and machine-generated texts. Notably, newer models output text that is similarly variable, pointing to an homogenization of machine-generated texts.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.14811v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional generative capabilities but are computationally intensive, posing significant challenges for deployment in resource-constrained or latency-sensitive environments. Quantization offers an effective means to reduce model size and computational cost, with post-training quantization (PTQ) being particularly appealing due to its compatibility with pre-trained models without requiring retraining or training data. However, existing PTQ methods for diffusion models often rely on architecture-specific heuristics that limit their generalizability and hinder integration with industrial deployment pipelines. To address these limitations, we propose SegQuant, a unified quantization framework that adaptively combines complementary techniques to enhance cross-model versatility. SegQuant consists of a segment-aware, graph-based quantization strategy (SegLinear) that captures structural semantics and spatial heterogeneity, along with a dual-scale quantization scheme (DualScale) that preserves polarity-asymmetric activations, which is crucial for maintaining visual fidelity in generated outputs. SegQuant is broadly applicable beyond Transformer-based diffusion models, achieving strong performance while ensuring seamless compatibility with mainstream deployment tools.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.15857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have long dominated the landscape of large language models, driving progress across a wide range of tasks. Recently, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though their advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where training involves repeated passes over limited data-and find that they significantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce. Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation loss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as implicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed left-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which diffusion begins to outperform AR. These results suggest that when data, not compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to the standard AR paradigm.

      "description": "arXiv:2507.17107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a key post-pretraining step for aligning large language models (LLMs) with complex tasks and human preferences. While it is often assumed that RL fine-tuning requires updating most of a model's parameters, we challenge this assumption with a surprising finding: RL fine-tuning consistently modifies only a small subnetwork (typically 5-30% of weights), leaving most parameters unchanged. We call this phenomenon RL-induced parameter update sparsity. It arises naturally, without any sparsity constraints or parameter-efficient tuning, and appears across multiple RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, DPO, SimPO, PRIME) and model families (e.g., OpenAI, Meta, and open-source LLMs). Moreover, the subnetworks updated by RL show substantial overlap across different seeds, datasets, and algorithms-far exceeding chance-suggesting a partially transferable structure in the pretrained model. We show that fine-tuning only this sparse subnetwork recovers full model performance and yields parameters nearly identical to the fully fine-tuned model. Our analysis suggests this sparsity emerges because RL operates near the model's original distribution, requiring only targeted changes. KL penalties, gradient clipping, and on-policy dynamics have limited effect on the sparsity pattern. These findings shed new light on how RL adapts models: not by shifting all weights, but by focusing training on a small, consistently updated subnetwork. This insight enables more efficient RL methods and reframes sparsity through the lens of the lottery ticket hypothesis.",

Along with the anticipated benefits of this technology, potential dangers arise from unforseen and inherent biases. Thus, assessing and improving the fairness of such systems is of utmost importance. A key challenge in fairness assessment is to ensure that the evaluation dataset is sufficiently representative of different Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sex, age, and race) and other minority groups. Against the backdrop of this challenge, this study leverages the state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) LightningDiT model to assess the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers. The results suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data is a promising direction. Yet, our findings indicate that verifying fairness becomes difficult when the melanoma-detection model used for evaluation is trained on data that differ from the dataset underpinning the synthetic images. Nonetheless, we propose that our approach offers a valuable new avenue for employing synthetic data to gauge and enhance fairness in medical-imaging GenAI systems.",

Yet little is known about how educators actually use these tools in practice and how their interactions with AI can be meaningfully studied at scale. This paper presents a human-AI collaborative methodology for large-scale qualitative analysis of over 140,000 educator-AI messages drawn from a generative AI platform used by K-12 teachers. Through a four-phase coding pipeline, we combined inductive theme discovery, codebook development, structured annotation, and model benchmarking to examine patterns of educator engagement and evaluate the performance of LLMs in qualitative coding tasks. We developed a hierarchical codebook aligned with established teacher evaluation frameworks, capturing educators' instructional goals, contextual needs, and pedagogical strategies. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs, particularly Claude 3.5 Haiku, can reliably support theme identification, extend human recognition in complex scenarios, and outperform open-weight models in both accuracy and structural reliability. The analysis also reveals substantive patterns in how educators inquire AI to enhance instructional practices (79.7 percent of total conversations), create or adapt content (76.1 percent), support assessment and feedback loop (46.9 percent), attend to student needs for tailored instruction (43.3 percent), and assist other professional responsibilities (34.2 percent), highlighting emerging AI-related competencies that have direct implications for teacher preparation and professional development.

To address these challenges in medical image segmentation, we introduce Diff-UMamba, a novel architecture that combines the UNet framework with the mamba mechanism to model long-range dependencies. At the heart of Diff-UMamba is a noise reduction module, which employs a signal differencing strategy to suppress noisy or irrelevant activations within the encoder. This encourages the model to filter out spurious features and enhance task-relevant representations, thereby improving its focus on clinically significant regions. As a result, the architecture achieves improved segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in low-data settings. Diff-UMamba is evaluated on multiple public datasets, including medical segmentation decathalon dataset (lung and pancreas) and AIIB23, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 1-3% over baseline methods in various segmentation tasks. To further assess performance under limited data conditions, additional experiments are conducted on the BraTS-21 dataset by varying the proportion of available training samples.

Following two successful green hydrogen project rounds, the country launched its third auction (R3) in the Duqm region. While this area exhibits relative geospatial homogeneity, it is still vulnerable to environmental fluctuations that pose inherent risks to productivity. Despite growing global investment in green hydrogen, operational data remains scarce, with major projects like Saudi Arabia's NEOM facility not expected to commence production until 2026, and Oman's ACME Duqm project scheduled for 2028. This absence of historical maintenance and performance data from large-scale hydrogen facilities in desert environments creates a major knowledge gap for accurate risk assessment for infrastructure planning and auction decisions. Given this data void, environmental conditions emerge as accessible and reliable proxy for predicting infrastructure maintenance pressures, because harsh desert conditions such as dust storms, extreme temperatures, and humidity fluctuations are well-documented drivers of equipment degradation in renewable energy systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an Artificial Intelligence decision support system that leverages publicly available meteorological data to develop a predictive Maintenance Pressure Index (MPI), which predicts risk levels and future maintenance demands on hydrogen infrastructure.

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offers a lightweight, off-policy alternative to RL for automatic prompt engineering, but its token-level regularization leaves semantic inconsistency unchecked as prompts that win higher preference scores can still drift away from the user's intended meaning.\n  We introduce Sem-DPO, a variant of DPO that preserves semantic consistency yet retains its simplicity and efficiency. Sem-DPO adjusts the DPO loss using a weight based on how different the winning prompt is from the original, reducing the impact of training examples that are semantically misaligned. We provide the first analytical bound on semantic drift for preference-tuned prompt generators, showing that Sem-DPO keeps learned prompts within a provably bounded neighborhood of the original text. On three standard text-to-image prompt-optimization benchmarks and two language models, Sem-DPO achieves 8-12% higher CLIP similarity and 5-9% higher human-preference scores (HPSv2.1, PickScore) than DPO, while also outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

      "description": "arXiv:2507.20217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Humanoid robot technology is advancing rapidly, with manufacturers introducing diverse heterogeneous visual perception modules tailored to specific scenarios. Among various perception paradigms, occupancy-based representation has become widely recognized as particularly suitable for humanoid robots, as it provides both rich semantic and 3D geometric information essential for comprehensive environmental understanding. In this work, we present Humanoid Occupancy, a generalized multimodal occupancy perception system that integrates hardware and software components, data acquisition devices, and a dedicated annotation pipeline. Our framework employs advanced multi-modal fusion techniques to generate grid-based occupancy outputs encoding both occupancy status and semantic labels, thereby enabling holistic environmental understanding for downstream tasks such as task planning and navigation. To address the unique challenges of humanoid robots, we overcome issues such as kinematic interference and occlusion, and establish an effective sensor layout strategy. Furthermore, we have developed the first panoramic occupancy dataset specifically for humanoid robots, offering a valuable benchmark and resource for future research and development in this domain. The network architecture incorporates multi-modal feature fusion and temporal information integration to ensure robust perception. Overall, Humanoid Occupancy delivers effective environmental perception for humanoid robots and establishes a technical foundation for standardizing universal visual modules, paving the way for the widespread deployment of humanoid robots in complex real-world scenarios.",

      "description": "arXiv:2507.20536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models have revolutionized content creation but remain highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, often requiring users to repeatedly refine prompts multiple times without clear feedback. While techniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings, denoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited controllability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the generalization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free multi-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large Language Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative refinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while enhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct generation. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input Interpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates a standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate model from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual prompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses aesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for potential regeneration. T2I-Copilot can operate fully autonomously while also supporting human-in-the-loop intervention for fine-grained control. On GenAI-Bench, using open-source generation models, T2I-Copilot achieves a VQA score comparable to commercial models RecraftV3 and Imagen 3, surpasses FLUX1.1-pro by 6.17% at only 16.59% of its cost, and outperforms FLUX.1-dev and SD 3.5 Large by 9.11% and 6.36%.

Epub 2025 Jul 30.ABSTRACTBuilding ethical machines may involve bestowing upon them the emotional capacity to self-evaluate and repent for their actions. While apologies represent potential strategic interactions, the explicit evolution of guilt as a behavioural trait remains poorly understood. Our study delves into the co-evolution of two forms of emotional guilt: social guilt entails a cost, requiring agents to exert efforts to understand others' internal states and behaviours; and non-social guilt, which only involves awareness of one's own state, incurs no social cost. Resorting to methods from evolutionary game theory, we study analytically, and through extensive numerical and agent-based simulations, whether and how guilt can evolve and deploy, depending on the underlying structure of the systems of agents. Our findings reveal that in lattice and scale-free networks, strategies favouring emotional guilt dominate a broader range of guilt and social costs compared to non-structured well-mixed populations, leading to higher levels of cooperation. In structured populations, both social and non-social guilt can thrive through clustering with emotionally inclined strategies, thereby providing protection against exploiters, particularly for less costly non-social strategies. These insights shed light on the complex interplay of guilt and cooperation, enhancing our understanding of ethical artificial intelligence.PMID:40735827 | DOI:10.1098/rsif.2025.0164",

However, their clinical performance remains limited due to challenges such as prolonged healing times and suboptimal repair quality. Moreover, in patients with certain pathological conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus and osteoporosis), disruptions in the bone microenvironment further compromise regenerative outcomes. To address these limitations, surface modification strategies have been developed to regulate implant-bone tissue interactions and improve therapeutic efficacy. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in bone regeneration implants with a focus on topographical modifications, encompassing design principles, underlying biological mechanisms, and therapeutic applications. Particular attention is given to the influence of implant surface topography on the biological behaviors of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and macrophages within the bone microenvironment, as well as their responses under complex pathological and physiological conditions. The review also discusses current challenges related to achieving micro/nanoscale structural balance, personalization, and clinical translation of implant surface topographies, and highlights future directions in precision bone regeneration through multidisciplinary approaches, artificial intelligence-driven optimization, and long-term clinical validation. Collectively, these insights may inform future research on bone implant materials and support the development of novel strategies for personalized treatment of bone defect repair.PMID:40735704 | PMC:PMC12305250 | DOI:10.1016/j.mtbio.2025.102066",

Early detection is critical for improving patient outcomes. These tumors pose substantial diagnostic challenges because of their varied manifestations, necessitating timely and accurate diagnosis. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have shown the potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, especially through MRI analysis. We analyzed the performance of AI algorithms for various types of tumors as well as for different diagnostic goals, with special consideration of assessing the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of AI for recognizing gliomas, meningiomas, and pituitary tumors, as well as for identifying tumor versus non-tumor tissue. By integrating both the performance metrics and the methodology used, this review offers an overall comparative analysis of AI-based diagnostic methods on brain tumor images. This study aims to systematically review the use of AI techniques in diagnosing brain tumors through MRI scans, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We conducted a search across multiple databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus. Our search encompassed publications from 2000 to February 2024. In total, we identified 79 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These criteria required the use of MRI for brain tumor detection and classification, and the utilization of clearly defined performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. To assess the quality of the studies, we employed the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Our meta-analysis specifically focused on evaluating the performance of different algorithms in relation to various types of brain tumors. The analysis incorporated data from seven selected articles. The meta-analysis shows that AI methods accurately diagnose brain tumors using MRI. The overall F1 score ranges from 0.945 to 0.958, with an estimated accuracy of 0.952. The top performers in this field are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), ensemble algorithms, and support vector machines. Among these, CNNs have a slightly higher F1 score (0.953) compared to ensemble algorithms (0.949). The accuracy varies depending on the tumor type, with gliomas having an F1 score of 0.961, pituitary tumors at 0.955, and meningiomas at 0.950. The meta-regression analysis reveals that tumor type significantly influences accuracy, with lower scores observed in the \"tumor/no tumor\" category. AI models demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy in controlled research settings (pooled accuracy: 0.952, 95% CI: 0.945-0.958), but significant heterogeneity (I²=40.75%) and performance variability across tumor types limit broad clinical generalizability. CNNs and ensemble algorithms show consistent results for glioma and pituitary tumors, but evidence for clinical deployment remains preliminary.PMID:40735661 | PMC:PMC12306512 | DOI:10.7759/cureus.88915",

Applicants invest significant time in writing their PSs, and still, program directors rank PSs among the least important factors in interview and rank order list decisions. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, has introduced questions of ethics and originality across all aspects of education, particularly in the generation of free-form documents such as the PS. This study evaluates whether AI-generated PSs are distinguishable from authentic ones written by applicants and their perceived impact on residency selection. Methods Five AI-generated PSs were created using ChatGPT, incorporating applicant location, hobbies, and career background. Five de-identified, authentic PSs randomly selected from incoming emergency medicine (EM) interns were used for comparison. A Qualtrics survey was distributed electronically to the Council of Residency Directors (CORD) community. Respondents rated the PSs on writing quality, ability to convey personal attributes, and perceived influence on interview decisions. Statistical analyses (ANOVA and Wilcoxon tests) were used to assess differences between AI-generated and authentic statements. Results A total of 66 responses were collected over a two-month period. Of these, eight respondents did not regularly review ERAS applications, and 28 did not complete the survey beyond the initial question, leaving 30 responses for analysis. There were no statistically significant differences between AI-generated and authentic PSs in grammar and writing style (p = 0.5897), expression of personal attributes (p = 0.6827), overall quality (p = 0.2757), or perceived influence on interview decisions (p = 0.5457). Free-text comments reflected skepticism about the value of the PS in the selection process. Conclusion AI-generated PSs performed comparably to authentic ones, potentially further challenging the relevance of PSs in residency applications. These findings suggest an inherent lack of originality in the PS and may support re-evaluating the role of the PS and even exploring more meaningful ways to assess applicant fit in the residency selection process. Novel methods, such as structured interviews, standardized video responses, personality inventories, or situational judgment tests, may be considered to supplement the role intended for the PS.PMID:40735658 | PMC:PMC12305746 | DOI:10.7759/cureus.88818",

Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the prevention and control strategy of citrus HLB. In this paper, the dynamics of HLB propagation between citrus trees and ACP is considered. By applying reinforcement learning (RL) technique, an event-driven optimal prevention control (EDOPC) strategy is developed to ensure the HLB propagation model state converges to a disease-free equilibrium point. Initially, in order to address the challenge of obtaining precise models in practice, a radial basis function-based event-driven observer is built by adopting system input-output data to obtain the approximate HLB propagation model. Subsequently, an EDOPC strategy is devised, which updates only at triggering times to reduce management costs. Additionally, a single critic network structure is constructed to obtain the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, thereby deriving an approximate EDOPC strategy. To align with real-world scenarios, the weights of the observer and the critic network are updated only at event occurrence times. Moreover, by employing the Lyapunov stability principle, the critic network weight error is proved to be uniformly ultimately bounded under the novel event-driven weight adjusting law. Finally, simulation experiments confirm the efficacy of the present RL-based EDOPC strategy.PMID:40735611 | PMC:PMC12305327 | DOI:10.1016/j.idm.2025.07.007",

To address these limitations, this paper introduces an explainable and lightweight deep learning framework comprising temporal convolutional networks and long short-term memory networks that efficiently classifies Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and healthy controls using electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Feature engineering has been conducted using modified Relative Band Power (RBP) analysis, leveraging six EEG frequency bands extracted through power spectrum density (PSD) calculations. The model achieves high classification accuracies of 99.7% for binary tasks and 80.34% for multi-class classification. Furthermore, to enhance the transparency and interpretability of the framework, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) has been utilized as an explainable artificial intelligence technique that provides insights into feature contributions.PMID:40735445 | PMC:PMC12303882 | DOI:10.3389/fmed.2025.1590201",

A review of the literature in this field is imperative. The purpose of this paper is to reveal the field's temporal, disciplinary, geographic, journal, and collaborative characteristics and summarize research themes and future trends to promote a systematic understanding of the field within the academic community.METHODS: To identify research trends, a bibliometric analysis of 1,209 publications retrieved from the Science Citation Index Expanded in the Web of Science core database was conducted.RESULTS: In terms of time series, publications in the field grew slowly until 2014, and publications in the field increased significantly after 2015, with polynomial models predicting 206, 233, and 263 annual publications over the next three years. In terms of disciplinary structure, three frontier disciplines utilized interdisciplinary knowledge provided by four basic disciplines to make cutting-edge breakthroughs. Geospatially, there is a three-way split between China, the United States, and the United Kingdom, while most African countries are not involved in the research. Regarding journal distribution, research in this field was published in five Q2 and four Q1 journals, mainly in computing, with fewer contributions from sports journals. The study identifies five principal research themes: skill optimization, health monitoring and injury prevention, physical performance assessment, tactical analysis and referee assistance, and immersive event experiences. Furthermore, it highlights existing research limitations and outlines directions for future exploration.CONCLUSIONS: Computer vision research in sports has shown high explosive growth in recent years.

Early detection and intervention are crucial for improving outcomes, yet many children are diagnosed late. The General Movements Assessment (GMA) is a highly accurate clinical tool for detecting infants at high probability of CP, but access to health professionals trained in the GMA limits its use. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to automate the GMA, increasing accessibility worldwide. We established an interdisciplinary, international consortium for the purpose of developing a roadmap for the ongoing development and implementation of an AI-enabled GMA system for universal CP screening worldwide. The consortium included clinicians (children neurologists, paediatricians, neonatologists, allied health), researchers, engineers, computer scientists, legal experts, and individuals with lived experience, from around the globe (across Africa, Australia, Europe, and North America). The roadmap identifies the following steps and key requirements within: (1) development of standards for AI validation; (2) development of AI-GMA from large and diverse validation sets; (3) development of software tools and clinical pathways; (4) regulatory requisites; and (5) implementation. With the roadmap, AI-enabled screening for CP incorporating state-of-the-art technology can be made possible.

With the growth of online platforms, patients increasingly turn to social media and health communities for support, research, and advocacy, expanding recruitment pools and established enrollment pathways. Recognizing this potential, we utilized TrialGPT, a framework that leverages a large language model (LLM) as its backbone, to match 50 online patient cases (collected from published case reports and a social media website) to clinical trials and evaluate performance against traditional keyword-based searches. Our results show that TrialGPT outperforms traditional methods by 46% in identifying eligible trials, with each patient, on average, being eligible for around 7 trials. Additionally, our outreach efforts to case authors and trial organizers regarding these patient-trial matches yielded highly positive feedback, which we present from both perspectives.PMID:40735091 | PMC:PMC12306814",

While artificial intelligence (AI) systems show promise in meeting these needs, robust datasets are needed to evaluate the factual accuracy and relevance of AI-generated responses. To our knowledge, no existing dataset captures patient information needs in the context of their EHRs. We introduce ArchEHR-QA, an expert-annotated dataset based on real-world patient cases from intensive care unit and emergency department settings. The cases comprise questions posed by patients to public health forums, clinician-interpreted counterparts, relevant clinical note excerpts with sentence-level relevance annotations, and clinician-authored answers. To establish benchmarks for grounded EHR question answering (QA), we evaluated three open-weight large language models (LLMs)--Llama 4, Llama 3, and Mixtral--across three prompting strategies: generating (1) answers with citations to clinical note sentences, (2) answers before citations, and (3) answers from filtered citations. We assessed performance on two dimensions: Factuality (overlap between cited note sentences and ground truth) and Relevance (textual and semantic similarity between system and reference answers). The final dataset contains 134 patient cases. The answer-first prompting approach consistently performed best, with Llama 4 achieving the highest scores. Manual error analysis supported these findings and revealed common issues such as omitted key clinical evidence and contradictory or hallucinated content. Overall, ArchEHR-QA provides a strong benchmark for developing and evaluating patient-centered EHR QA systems, underscoring the need for further progress toward generating factual and relevant responses in clinical contexts.PMID:40735090 | PMC:PMC12306830",

However, contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI), the third most common cause of hospital-acquired renal failure, remains a critical complication of PCI.OBJECTIVE: To develop a machine learning model predicting CI-AKI risk in elderly patients with STEMI patients using clinical features.METHODS: Data from 2120 elderly patients with STEMI treated with PCI at Xuzhou Medical University Affiliated Hospital (2019-2023) were used for model development and testing. An external validation cohort, comprising 236 individuals, was derived from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database (2008-2019). Lasso regression selected predictors, and nine Machine Learning (ML) algorithms were evaluated via Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Overlapping top-ranked features from high-performing models (AUC >0.8) informed a nomogram. Performance was assessed using AUC and decision curve analysis (DCA).RESULTS: The final model included five independent predictors: lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio, diuretic use, residual cholesterol, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen. This model was developed as a simple-to-use online dynamic nomogram. It demonstrated robust discrimination, with C-statistics of 0.782 in the testing dataset and 0.791 in the validation dataset.

Preventive approaches should consider all of these factors to help identify at-risk individuals. Advanced machine-learning tools and artificial intelligence can be utilized for this purpose. This study aimed to develop an effective injury prediction model for lower-limb sports injuries.METHODS: A total of 120 male university-level football, cricket, and basketball players underwent elaborate mental and physical screening, accounting for 44 variables. The injury details of the previous season were recorded. Using these data, different injury-predicting muscle-learning models were built, and their efficiencies were compared.RESULTS: Thirty-eight injuries were recorded, 20 (52.6 %) of which corresponded to ankle injuries, nine to hamstring injuries (23.6 %), four to knee injuries (10.5 %), and five to foot injuries (13.3 %). Eight injuries occurred during the training phase, and 30 injuries occurred during the competition. Six players sustained the injuries twice. In this case, only the initial injury was considered. Finally, thirty-two injuries were used to construct the model. The model generated by the K Nearest Neighbour algorithm (KNN) with Random Oversampling (ROS) as an oversampling technique was found to be the best (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve score = 0.87, true positive rate = 100 %, true negative rate = 62.5 %).CONCLUSIONS: The machine learning KNN model with ROS showed good accuracy in predicting athletes prone to injuries in football, cricket and basketball.

Thus, it is recognized as a valuable species of interest in the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries due to its important medicinal properties. Recent advances in omics technologies such as genomes, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics have considerably increased our understanding of the bioactives in G. lucidum. This review explores the application of molecular breeding techniques to enhance both the yield and quality of G. lucidum across the food, pharmaceutical, and industrial sectors. The article discusses the current state of research on the use of contemporary omics technologies which studies and highlights future research directions that may increase the production of bioactive compounds for their therapeutic potential. Additionally, predictive methods with computational studies have recently emerged as effective tools for investigating bioactive constituents in G. lucidum, providing an organized and cost-effective strategy for understanding their bioactivity, interactions, and possible therapeutic uses.

The evolving nomenclature and understanding of MASLD necessitate updated insights into its pathophysiology, diagnostics, and internal medicine management. A comprehensive literature review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases for articles published between 2018 and 2025. Eligible studies included human-based clinical or translational research addressing MASLD pathogenesis, diagnostics, and management. Non-invasive scoring systems, pharmacotherapies, and multidisciplinary management strategies were evaluated. The pathological progression of MASLD spans from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Key pathogenic mechanisms involve insulin resistance, adipokine imbalance, gut-liver axis dysregulation, and genetic polymorphisms such as PNPLA3. Diagnostic approaches have shifted toward non-invasive tools, including Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4), NAFLD Fibrosis Score, Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) score, Vibration-Controlled Transient Elastography (VCTE), and magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF). Lifestyle modification remains the cornerstone of management, but promising pharmacologic therapies, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, vitamin E, pioglitazone, and resmetirom, are emerging. Multidisciplinary risk factor control, including diabetes, lipid, and blood pressure management, is critical. Emerging biomarkers and multi-omics technologies, alongside artificial intelligence, are redefining MASLD stratification and therapeutic monitoring. Early identification and comprehensive management of MASLD are essential to prevent advanced liver disease and associated comorbidities. With evolving nomenclature, non-invasive diagnostics, and emerging therapies, internal medicine practitioners must adopt an integrative, multidisciplinary approach to care.

PV can do this by collecting and analyzing data from a wide variety of healthcare sources. However, traditional PV methods face limitations, particularly in accurately and efficiently analyzing large datasets. This limitation leads to underreported ADRs, which negatively impact many patients. However, with the recent rise in artificial intelligence, PV as a science has the potential to improve. This can be done by incorporating different subsets of AI, such as machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), into PV. The aim of this study is to describe how integrating AI, specifically ML and NLP, into PV systems can improve data collection, data processing, and the detection of ADRs. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar to examine studies that were conducted within the last 30 years. Twenty-eight studies were included in this paper. Inclusion criteria included articles that were written in English, articles focusing on PV as a science, ADRs, AI's current role in PV, and AI's potential role in PV. Exclusion criteria included studies that were not published in English and studies that were published more than 30 years ago. The findings from several systematic reviews that explore the implementation of AI into PV indicate that AI can improve PV by enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of detecting ADRs. Through ML algorithms, ADRs can be identified more quickly and accurately compared to traditional PV methods; while using the NLP model, AI is able to extract relevant patient data from unstructured data sources such as electronic health records (EHRs) and report certain drug interactions more accurately and efficiently. However, there are limitations to incorporating AI into PV. These include ethical, legal, and privacy concerns; interpretative limitations if certain datasets are incomplete and are missing information; the lack of current research; and the need to conduct more research on this topic to definitively determine whether AI should be incorporated into PV. With the exponential development of technology such as AI, there is a lot of promise in strengthening PV into a more accurate and efficient ADR detection system. While there is some research highlighting AI's potential to enhance PV, much more research needs to be conducted to fully substantiate this claim. Incorporating AI into PV does, however, have the potential to change ADR detection methods for the better.PMID:40734859 | PMC:PMC12306650 | DOI:10.7759/cureus.86972",

Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) offers potential for improved characterization, yet its optimal application in conjunction with machine learning for this differentiation is not fully established.METHODS: This prospective study enrolled 476 participants (99 with emphysema, 377 with emphysema-dominant COPD) aged 34-88 years. All participants underwent spirometry and chest CT scans. QCT features including emphysema index, mean lung density, airway measurements, and vessel measurements were extracted. A random forest model was developed using these QCT features to differentiate between the two groups. The model's performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Correlations between QCT parameters and pulmonary function tests were analyzed.RESULTS: The model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.96-0.99) in differentiating emphysema from emphysema-dominant COPD. Emphysema index and airway wall thickness were the most important features for classification. QCT-derived emphysema index showed strong negative correlation with FEV1/FVC (ρ = -0.54, p<0.001) in the emphysema-dominant COPD group, but no significant correlation in the emphysema group (ρ = 0.001, p=0.993). Mean lung density was significantly lower in the emphysema-dominant COPD group compared to the isolated emphysema group (p<0.001).CONCLUSION: Machine learning analysis of QCT features can accurately differentiate emphysema from emphysema-dominant COPD. The differing relationships between QCT parameters and lung function in these two groups suggest distinct pathophysiological processes. These findings may contribute to improved diagnosis, phenotyping, and management strategies in emphysema and COPD.PMID:40734725 | PMC:PMC12306568 | DOI:10.2147/COPD.S527914",

Existing diagnostic tools, such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool, have limitations, such as dependence on structured datasets and difficulty identifying all high-risk individuals.OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop and validate an AI-enabled chest X-ray (AI-CXR) model for predicting osteoporotic fracture risk, offering a noninvasive, accessible alternative.DESIGN: This is a retrospective study.METHODS: This study analyzed 166,571 CXR from 78,548 patients in Taiwan, with internal validation on 31,977 X-rays and external validation on 36,677 X-rays. The datasets were divided into groups with and without T-scores. Radiological features such as costophrenic angle blunting and degenerative joint disease were extracted and incorporated into the predictive framework. The model's performance was assessed using concordance indices, calibration curves, and stratified risk analyses, and compared to DXA-based T-scores.RESULTS: The AI-CXR model demonstrated superior predictive accuracy compared to DXA, particularly for patients without T-scores (internal validation: concordance index 0.896 vs 0.829; external validation: 0.778 vs 0.818). Among high-risk groups identified by AI-CXR, the 5-year fracture incidence was significantly higher than in low-risk groups (internal: 2.6% vs 0.3%, hazard ratio (HR): 2.01; external: 3.5% vs 0.5%, HR: 2.34). Key radiological features were more prevalent in high-risk groups, including costophrenic angle blunting and degenerative joint disease. Stratified analysis revealed consistent performance across various demographic subgroups, such as gender and age categories.CONCLUSION: The AI-CXR model provides a cost-effective, noninvasive tool for osteoporotic fracture risk assessment, enabling improved early detection and personalized intervention across diverse clinical settings.PMID:40734685 | PMC:PMC12304508 | DOI:10.1177/1759720X251357157",

This review aimed to clarify contemporary views on the nature of micturition disorders and to try to determine which amenities might be useful for older people with micturition disorders. PubMed and Google Scholar search engines were used to search for English-language full-text articles using the keywords: \"micturition disorders,\" \"bladder changes,\" \"neurological disorders,\" \"hypoactive detrusor,\" \"improvements,\" \"technology,\" \"quality of life improvement,\" \"elderly,\" \"accessibility,\" \"public toilets,\" \"interior design\". Forty-one articles were selected for the final analysis. With age the structure of the bladder walls changes. At the same time, there are physiological changes in the nervous system that make ideal control of continence and micturition difficult. In older men, benign prostate hypertrophy is a common urinary tract disorder, in women there is pelvic organ prolapse and mucosal atrophy due to hypoestrogenism, and in both sexes an increase in infections. Older people are more likely to have diseases of other systems that affect urinary function (stroke, Parkinson's disease, dementia, circulatory failure, diabetes). Urinary incontinence, is a major social problem that significantly affects the quality of life of seniors. E-visits, medical chatbots, medical apps, and examinations performed at the patient's home or in the general practitioner's outpatient clinic can facilitate access to medical services for these patients. There is a need to improve accessibility to specialists, rehabilitation, medication, hygiene products as well as easy access to toilets at home and in the urban environment. The development of electronic devices, mobile applications and use of artificial intelligence, can improve the quality of life of seniors also regarding urinary disorders.

Epub 2025 Jul 30.ABSTRACTMigraine is a complex neurobiological disorder characterized by diverse phenotypes and unpredictable therapy outcomes. Digital phenotyping (DP), defined as the real-time collection of behavioral and physiological data in natural environments to identify individual phenotypes, represents a promising approach with the potential to enhance clinicians' ability to identify migraine subtypes. Additionally, DP offers new insights into the intricate neurobiological and behavioral patterns, as well as environmental influences, associated with each phase of a migraine attack, including potential triggers, pre-attack symptoms, the characteristics of an attack and response to treatment. Moreover, a DP-based approach has the potential to revolutionize migraine research and clinical trials by enabling more personalized, patient-centred diagnostics and tailored acute and preventive treatments. Despite the limited literature available and the heterogeneity of study designs, migraine DP may lay the groundwork for future digital twin models and the discovery of digital biomarkers for diagnosis, therapy optimization and outcome evaluation. Furthermore, DP could serve as a predictive marker for migraine attacks, empowering patients to monitor their condition and adopt a proactive approach to treatment. Integrating DP into migraine studies could also contribute to the development of an updated international migraine classification that incorporates neurobiological and psychosocial factors alongside clinical symptomatology. To fully realize its potential in migraine research and care, experts should prioritize collaboration with artificial intelligence (AI) specialists, data scientists and medical engineers. Establishing a multidisciplinary ecosystem will be essential to developing robust and clinically meaningful DP tools for migraine research. This review aims to show the current landscape of both active and passive DP methodologies, which leverage smartphones, wearable biosensors and AI-driven analytics to capture real-time physiological, cognitive and environmental data, at the same time as pointing to the future ahead of migraine DP.PMID:40734464 | DOI:10.1177/03331024251363568",

      "description": "NMR Biomed. 2025 Sep;38(9):e70107. doi: 10.1002/nbm.70107.ABSTRACTMulti-component T1ρ mapping of the knee joint using nonlinear least squares (NLS)-based methods is usually a computationally intensive task, limiting its application to only a few voxels in the knee joint. Deep learning (DL) is a computationally fast alternative, but requires a large amount of training data. We propose the Synthetic data-Guided supervised DL Network (SGDNet) that utilizes synthetically generated data for training, eliminating the need for large datasets of T1ρ maps. Initially, residual connections are added to improve gradient flow and stabilize training. A self-attention module is also integrated into the SGDNet to obtain more accurate estimated relaxation maps. Additionally, to ensure both parameter fidelity and data consistency, we employ a customized loss function that penalizes discrepancies between actual and predicted T1ρ values as well as between measured and simulated MR signals. To combine speed and precision, we further introduce HSGDNet, a hybrid approach that uses SGDNet's outputs as initialization for a few NLS iterations. Extensive experimental analysis reveals that HSGDNet outperforms the competing methods by achieving average error reductions of 91.4%, 31.5%, and 36.0% for mono-exponential (ME), stretched-exponential (SE), and bi-exponential (BE) components, respectively. HSGDNet accelerates whole-knee T1ρ fitting over NLS by approximately 67.4 × for ME, 53.9 × for SE, and 42.3 × for BE. Finally, to evaluate robustness under pathological and protocol variations, we validate HSGDNet on an early osteoarthritis (EOA) dataset acquired with distinct spin-lock times (TSLs) values. Overall, HSGDNet establishes itself as an efficient method for rapid, precise, and robust multi-component T1ρ mapping in the knee joint.PMID:40734420 | DOI:10.1002/nbm.70107",

Online ahead of print.ABSTRACTObjective: To evaluate the accuracy of the oral healthcare information provided by different large language models (LLM) to explore their feasibility and limitations in the application of oral auxiliary, treatment and health consultation. Methods: This study designed eight items comprising 47 questions in total related to the diagnosis and treatment of oral diseases [to assess the performance of LLM as an artificial intelligence (AI) medical assistant], and five items comprising 35 questions in total about oral health consultations (to assess the performance of LLM as a simulated doctor). These questions were answered individually by the five LLM models (Erine Bot, HuatuoGPT, Tongyi Qianwen, iFlytek Spark, ChatGPT). Two attending physicians with more than 5 years of experience independently rated the responses using the 3C criteria (correct, clear, concise), and the consistency between the raters was assessed using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient, and the Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn post hoc test were used to assess the statistical differences between the models. Additionally, this study used 600 questions from the 2023 dental licensing examination to evaluate the time taken to answer, scores, and accuracy of each model. Results: As an AI medical assistant, LLM can assist doctors in diagnosis and treatment decision-making, with an inter-evaluator Spearman coefficient of 0.505 (P<0.01). As a simulated doctor, LLM can carry out patient popularization, with an inter-evaluator Spearman coefficient of 0.533 (P<0.01). The 3C scoring results were represented by the median (lower quartile, upper quartile), and the 3C scores of each model as an AI medical assistant and a simulated doctor were respectively: 2.00 (1.00, 3.00) and 2.00 (1.00, 3.00) points of Erine Bot, 1.00 (1.00, 2.00) and 2.00 (1.00, 2.00) points of HuatuoGPT, 2.00 (1.00, 2.00) and 2.00 (1.00, 3.00) points of Tongyi Qianwen, 2.00 (1.00, 2.00) and 2.00 (1.75, 2.25) points of iFlytek Spark, 3.00 (2.00, 3.00) and 3.00 (2.00, 3.00) points of ChatGPT (full score of 4 points). The Kruskal-Wallis test results showed that, as an AI medical assistant or a simulated doctor, there were statistically differences in the 3C scores among the five large language models (all P<0.001). The average score of the 5 LLMs on the dental licensing examination was 370.2, with an accuracy rate of 61.7% (370.2/600) and a time consumption of 94.6 minutes. Specifically, Erine Bot took 115 minutes, scored 363 points with an accuracy rate of 60.5% (363/600), HuatuoGPT took 224 minutes and scored 305 points with an accuracy rate of 50.8% (305/600), Tongyi Qianwen took 43 minutes, scored 438 points with an accuracy rate of 73.0% (480/600), iFlytek Spark took 32 minutes, scored 364 points with an accuracy rate of 60.7% (364/600), and ChatGPT took 59 minutes, scored 381 points with an accuracy rate of 63.5% (381/600). Conclusions: Based on the evaluation of LLM's dual roles as an AI medical assistant and a simulated doctor, ChatGPT performes the best, with basically correct, clear and concise answers, followed by Erine Bot, Tongyi Qianwen and iFlytek Spark, with HuatuoGPT lagging behind significantly. In the dental licensing examination, all the 4 LLM, except for HuatuoGPT, reach the passing level, and the time consumpution for answering is significantly reduced compared to the 8 h required for the exam regulations in all of the five models. LLM has the feasibility of application in oral auxiliary, treatment and health consultation, and it can help both doctors and patients obtain medical information quickly. Howere, their outputs carry a risk of errors (since the 3C scoring results do not reach the full marks), so prudent judgment should be exercised when using them.PMID:40734399 | DOI:10.3760/cma.j.cn112144-20241107-00418",

Online ahead of print.ABSTRACTWith the continuous advancement of dental medicine and the increasing prevalence of digital technology, occlusal reconstruction has entered a new era characterized by high precision, efficiency, and predictability. This paper focuses on the digital workflow of full-dentition occlusal reconstruction, integrating multimodal data such as intraoral scanning, facial scanning, cone-beam CT, and mandibular movement tracking. By utilizing a domestic artificial intelligence platform, a virtual patient model for oral rehabilitation is established. The workflow encompasses five key stages: preliminary preparation, digital adjustment of jaw relations, transitional restoration verification, definitive restoration, and follow-up maintenance, ensuring the precise realization of treatment objectives.

An analysis of studies on the use of convolutional neural networks in the cytological diagnosis of the thyroid pathology was performed. According to the results, these neural networks classify pathological conditions with high accuracy and sensitivity, comparable to the work of an experienced cytologist. The accuracy of classification of papillary carcinoma can reach 99.7%. However, the lack of uniform standards for preparing images for training neural networks, the insufficient number of studies using multicenter data, and the narrow diagnostic range of available neural network models still limit the implementation of such AI systems in cytological diagnostic practice.CONCLUSION:  The available research results on various options for using convolutional neural networks in the cytological diagnosis of the thyroid pathology have every chance of becoming the initiator of a serious paradigm shift in conventional cytopathology towards digital and computational cytopathology, in which the main functions will be performed by AI systems.PMID:40734294 | DOI:10.14341/probl13475",

Variations in amylose-to-amylopectin ratio significantly influence starch digestibility, texture, glycemic response and dietary fiber functionality. However, conventional techniques such as iodine binding, enzymatic assays and chromatographic separation are often destructive, time-consuming and unable to provide spatially resolved molecular information. Here, we present a non-destructive, label-free approach combining Raman micro-spectroscopy with machine learning to simultaneously classify and quantify amylose and amylopectin within single starch granules. Raman spectra were collected from seven starch varieties and analyzed using multivariate techniques and machine learning including Principal Component Analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines, which enabled accurate discrimination based on spectral features. Key Raman marker bands including 856 and 941 cm-1 for amylose (α-1,4 linkages) and 871 cm-1 for amylopectin (α-1,6 branching) were identified and used in a semi-supervised Multivariate Curve Resolution analysis to resolve overlapping signals and extract pure molecular profiles.

A few human cases have been linked to the infection with this clade in many parts of the world, including the USA. Unfortunately, there are no specific vaccines or antiviral drugs that could help prevent and treat the infection caused by this virus in birds. Our major objective is to identify/repurpose some (novel/known) antiviral compounds that may inhibit viral replication by targeting some key viral proteins. (2) Methods: We used state-of-the-art machine learning tools such as molecular docking and MD-simulation methods from Biovia Discovery Studio (v24.1.0.321712). The key target proteins such as hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), Matrix-2 protein (M2), and the cap-binding domain of PB2 (PB2/CBD) homology models were validated through structural assessment via DOPE scores, Ramachandran plots, and Verify-3D metrics, ensuring reliable structural representations, confirming their reliability for subsequent in silico approaches. These approaches include molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics simulation for 50 nanoseconds (ns), highlighting the structural stability and compactness of the docked complexes. (3) Results: Molecular docking revealed strong binding affinities for both sofosbuvir and GS441524, particularly with the NA and PB2/CBD protein targets. Among them, GS441524 exhibited superior interaction scores and a greater number of hydrogen bonds with key functional residues of NA and PB2/CBD. The MM-GBSA binding free energy calculations further supported these findings, as GS441524 displayed more favorable binding energies compared to several known standard inhibitors, including F0045S for HA, Zanamivir for NA, Rimantadine and Amantadine for M2, and PB2-39 for PB2/CBD. Additionally, 50 ns molecular dynamics simulations highlighted the structural stability and compactness of the GS441524-PB2/CBD complex, further supporting its potential as a promising antiviral candidate. Furthermore, hydrogen bond monitor analysis over the 50 ns simulation confirmed persistent and specific interactions between the ligand and proteins, suggesting that GS441524 may effectively inhibit the NA, and PB2/CBD might potentially disrupt PB2-mediated RNA synthesis. (4) Conclusions: Our findings are consistent with previous evidence supporting the antiviral activity of certain nucleoside analog inhibitors, including GS441524, against various coronaviruses. These results further support the potential repurposing of GS441524 as a promising therapeutic candidate against H5N1 avian influenza clade 2.3.4.4b. However, further functional studies are required to validate these in silico predictions and support the inhibitory action of GS441524 against the targeted proteins of H5N1, specifically clade 2.3.4.4b.PMID:40733589 | DOI:10.3390/v17070972",

      "description": "Viruses. 2025 Jul 2;17(7):943. doi: 10.3390/v17070943.ABSTRACTBACKGROUND: In just twenty years, three dangerous human coronaviruses-SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 have exposed critical gaps in early detection of emerging viral threats. Current diagnostics remain pathogen-focused, often missing the earliest phase of infection. A virus-agnostic, host-based diagnostic capable of detecting responses to viral intrusion is urgently needed.METHODS: We hypothesized that the lungs act as biomechanical instruments, with infection altering tissue tension, wave propagation, and flow dynamics in ways detectable through subaudible vibroacoustic signals. In a matched case-control study, we enrolled 19 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 inpatients and 16 matched controls across two Johns Hopkins hospitals. Multimodal data were collected, including passive vibroacoustic auscultation, lung ultrasound, peak expiratory flow, and laboratory markers. Machine learning models were trained to identify host-response biosignatures from anterior chest recordings.RESULTS: 19 COVID-19 inpatients and 16 matched controls (mean BMI 32.4 kg/m2, mean age 48.6 years) were successfully enrolled to the study. The top-performing, unoptimized, vibroacoustic-only model achieved an AUC of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.67-0.92). The host-covariate optimized model achieved an AUC of 1.0 (95% CI: 0.94-1.0), with 100% sensitivity (95% CI: 82-100%) and 99.6% specificity (95% CI: 85-100%). Vibroacoustic data from the anterior chest alone reliably distinguished COVID-19 cases from controls.CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that passive, noninvasive vibroacoustic biosignatures can detect host response to viral infection in a hospitalized population and supports further testing of this modality in broader populations. These findings support the development of scalable, host-based diagnostics to enable early, agnostic detection of future pandemic threats (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT04556149).PMID:40733560 | DOI:10.3390/v17070943",

Few compounds have advanced clinically, underscoring the difficulty in optimizing both target affinity and drug-like properties. To address this challenge, we integrated machine learning (ML), molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the balance between pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties in Mpro inhibitor design. We developed ML models to classify Mpro inhibitors based on experimental IC50 data, combining molecular descriptors with structural insights from MD simulations. Our Support Vector Machine (SVM) model achieved strong performance (training accuracy = 0.84, ROC AUC = 0.91; test accuracy = 0.79, ROC AUC = 0.86), while our Logistic Regression model (training accuracy = 0.78, ROC AUC = 0.85; test accuracy = 0.76, ROC AUC = 0.83). Notably, PK descriptors often exhibited opposing trends to binding affinity: hydrophilic features enhanced binding affinity but compromised PK properties, whereas hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic, and π-π interactions in Mpro subsites S2 and S3/S4 are fundamental for binding affinity. Our findings highlight the need for a balanced approach in Mpro inhibitor design, strategically targeting these subsites may balance PD and PK properties. For the first time, we demonstrate antagonistic trends between pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) features through the integrated application of ML/MD. This study provides a computational framework for rational Mpro inhibitors, combining ML and MD to investigate the complex interplay between enzyme inhibition and drug likeness. These insights may guide the hit-to-lead optimization of the novel next-generation Mpro inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 with preclinical and clinical potential.PMID:40733553 | DOI:10.3390/v17070935",

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as promising tools to analyze complex clinical and molecular data. However, it remains unclear which AI or ML models are most suitable for infectious disease management, as most existing studies use non-scoping literature reviews to recommend AI and ML models for data analysis. This scoping literature review thus examines the ML models and applications that are most relevant for infectious disease management, with a proposed actionable workflow for implementing ML models in clinical practice. We conducted a literature search on PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect, including papers published in English between January 2020 and April 2024. Search keywords included AI, ML, public health, surveillance, diagnosis, prognosis, and infectious disease, to identify published studies using AI and ML in infectious disease management. Studies without public datasets or lacking descriptions of the ML models were excluded. This review included a total of 77 studies applied in surveillance, prognosis, and diagnosis. Different types of input data from infectious disease surveillance, clinical diagnosis, and prognosis required different ML and AI models to achieve the maximum performance in infectious disease management. Our findings highlight the potential of Explainable AI and ensemble learning models to be more broadly applicable in different aspects of infectious disease management, which can be integrated in clinical workflows to improve infectious disease surveillance, diagnosis, and prognosis. Explainable AI and ensemble learning models can be suitably used to achieve high accuracy in prediction. However, as most of the studies have not been validated in different cohorts, it remains unclear whether these ML models can be broadly applicable to different populations.

An important strategy involves reactivating tumor suppressor genes, particularly p53, by targeting their negative regulator MDM2, which is essential in promoting cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Leveraging a drug repurposing approach, we screened over 24,000 clinically tested molecules to identify new MDM2 inhibitors. A key innovation of this work is the development and application of a selective cleaning algorithm that systematically filters assay data to mitigate noise and inconsistencies inherent in large-scale bioactivity datasets. This approach significantly improved the predictive accuracy of our machine learning model for pIC50 values, reducing RMSE by 21.6% and achieving state-of-the-art performance (R2 = 0.87)-a substantial improvement over standard data preprocessing pipelines. The optimized model was integrated with structure-based virtual screening via molecular docking to prioritize repurposing candidate compounds. We identified two clinical CB1 antagonists, MePPEP and otenabant, and the statin drug atorvastatin as promising repurposing candidates based on their high predicted potency and binding affinity toward MDM2. Interactions with the related proteins MDM4 and BCL2 suggest these compounds may enhance p53 restoration through multi-target mechanisms. Quantum mechanical (ONIOM) optimizations and molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the stability and favorable interaction profiles of the selected protein-ligand complexes, resembling that of navtemadlin, a known MDM2 inhibitor.

While progress has been made in vaccine development, effective antiviral treatments remain limited, particularly those targeting the papain-like protease (PLpro) of SARS-CoV-2. PLpro plays a key role in viral replication and immune evasion, making it an attractive yet underexplored target for drug repurposing. In this study, we combined machine learning, molecular dynamics, and molecular docking to identify potential PLpro inhibitors in existing drugs. We performed long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations on PLpro-ligand complexes at two known binding sites, followed by structural clustering to capture representative structures. These were used for molecular docking, including a training set of 127 compounds and a library of 1107 FDA-approved drugs. A random forest model, trained on the docking scores of the representative conformations, yielded 76.4% accuracy via leave-one-out cross-validation.

Raman and NIR spectra were collected for rice samples processed under different conditions and integrated with reference analyses to develop and validate partial least squares regression and artificial neural network models. The optimized PLSR model demonstrated strong predictive performance, with R2 values of 0.9406 and 0.9365 for SG and HRY, respectively, and residual predictive deviations of 3.98 and 3.75 using Raman effective wavelengths. ANN models reached R2 values of 0.97 for both SG and HRY, with RPDs exceeding 4.2 using NIR effective wavelengths. In the aroma compound analysis, p-Cymene exhibited the highest predictive accuracy, with R2 values of 0.9916 for calibration, and 0.9814 for cross-validation. Other volatiles, such as 1-Octen-3-ol, nonanal, benzaldehyde, and limonene, demonstrated high predictive reliability (R2 ≥ 0.93; RPD > 3.0). Conversely, farnesene, menthol, and menthone showed poor predictability (R2 < 0.15; RPD < 0.4). Principal component analysis revealed that the first principal component explained 90% of the total variance in the Raman dataset and 71% in the NIR dataset. Hotelling's T2 analysis identifies influential outliers and enhances model robustness. Optimal processing conditions for achieving maximum HRY and SG values were determined at 65 °C soaking for 180 min, followed by drying at 70 °C.

Based on literature data, an ML model was developed by our group to predict the formation of binary co-amorphous systems (COAMSs) for inhalation therapy. The model's ability to develop a dry powder formulation with the necessary properties for a predicted co-amorphous combination was evaluated. Methods: An extended experimental validation of the ML model by co-milling and X-ray diffraction analysis for 18 API-API (active pharmaceutical ingredient) combinations is presented. Additionally, one COAMS of rifampicin (RIF) and ethambutol (ETH), two first-line tuberculosis (TB) drugs are developed further for inhalation therapy. Results: The ML model has shown an accuracy of 79% in predicting suitable combinations for 35 APIs used in inhalation therapy; experimental accuracy was demonstrated to be 72%. The study confirmed the successful development of stable COAMSs of RIF-ETH either via spray-drying or co-milling. In particular, the milled COAMSs showed better aerosolization properties (higher ED and FPF with lower standard deviation).

Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) constitute an interesting approach to increase drug bioavailability and safety. However, the development of nanoparticle-based formulations is challenging. In the present work, a combination of smart pharmaceutical technology approaches was proposed to develop CFZ-loaded NLCs, taking advantage of previous knowledge on NLCs screening. Methods: A design space previously established using Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools was applied to develop CFZ-loaded NLC formulations. After formulation characterization, Neurofuzzy Logic (NFL) and in silico docking simulations were employed to enhance the understanding of lipid nanocarriers. Then, the performance of formulations designed following NFL guidelines was characterized in terms of biocompatibility, using murine fibroblasts, and antimicrobial activity against several strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Results: The followed approach enabled CFZ-loaded NLC formulations with optimal properties, including small size and high antimicrobial payload. NFL was useful to investigate the existing interactions between NLC components and homogenization conditions, that influence CFZ-loaded NLCs' final properties. Also, in silico docking simulations were successfully applied to examine interactions and affinity between the drug and the lipid matrix components. Finally, the designed CFZ-loaded formulations demonstrated suitable biocompatibility, together with antimicrobial activity.

A systematic approach is needed for the optimization of this method due to the numerous processing variables involved. This study investigated the influence of six variables: alginate and konjac glucomannan concentrations, compressed airflow, liquid pump pressures, and nozzle configuration. A hybrid software using Artificial Neural Networks and genetic algorithms was used to model and optimize the hydrogel formation, achieving a 100% desirable solution. The optimal formulation identified resulted in particles displaying a log-normal size distribution (R2 = 0.967) with an average diameter of 1.57 mm.

Combining porous structures with embedded magnetic particles, these materials address challenges such as leakage and sedimentation, typically encountered in conventional MR fluids while offering advantages like lightweight design, acoustic absorption, high energy harvesting capability, and tailored mechanical responses. Despite their potential, challenges such as non-uniform particle dispersion, limited durability under cyclic loads, and suboptimal magneto-mechanical coupling continue to hinder their broader adoption. This review systematically addresses these issues by evaluating the synthesis methods (ex situ vs. in situ), microstructural design strategies, and the role of magnetic particle alignment under varying curing conditions. Special attention is given to the influence of material composition-including matrix types, magnetic fillers, and additives-on the mechanical and magnetorheological behaviors. While the primary focus of this review is on MR foams, relevant studies on MR elastomers, which share fundamental principles, are also considered to provide a broader context. Recent advancements are also discussed, including the growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the rheological and magneto-mechanical behavior of MR materials, model complex device responses, and optimize material composition and processing conditions. AI applications in MR systems range from estimating shear stress, viscosity, and storage/loss moduli to analyzing nonlinear hysteresis, magnetostriction, and mixed-mode loading behavior. These data-driven approaches offer powerful new capabilities for material design and performance optimization, helping overcome long-standing limitations in conventional modeling techniques. Despite significant progress in MR foams, several challenges remain to be addressed, including achieving uniform particle dispersion, enhancing viscoelastic performance (storage modulus and MR effect), and improving durability under cyclic loading. Addressing these issues is essential for unlocking the full potential of MR foams in demanding applications where consistent performance, mechanical reliability, and long-term stability are crucial for safety, effectiveness, and operational longevity. By bridging experimental methods, theoretical modeling, and AI-driven design, this work identifies pathways toward enhancing the functionality and reliability of MR foams for applications in vibration damping, energy harvesting, biomedical devices, and soft robotics.PMID:40732777 | DOI:10.3390/polym17141898",

However, variability in experimental CM (ECM) incidence, onset, and mortality introduce challenges when analyses rely solely on infection day, which may reflect different disease stages among animals.METHODS: We applied machine learning to predict ECM risk and onset in a cohort of 153 C57BL/6, 164 CBA, and 53 Swiss Webster mice. First, we fitted a logistic regression model to estimate the risk of ECM at any day using parasitemia data from day 1 to day 4. Next, we developed and trained a Random Forest Regressor model to predict the exact day of symptom onset.RESULTS: A total of 64.5% of the cohort developed ECM, with onset ranging between 5 and 11 days. Early increases in parasitemia were strong predictors for the development of ECM, with an increase in parasitemia equal to or greater than 0.05 between day 1 and day 3 predicting the development of ECM with 97% sensitivity.

In the crowded and poorly ventilated cabins of Almaty's metro, buses, and trolleybuses, concentrations of CO2 and PM2.5 often accumulate, elevating the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. This study investigates the air quality along three of the city's busiest transport corridors, analyzing how the concentrations of CO2, PM2.5, and PM10, as well as the temperature and relative humidity, fluctuate with the passenger density and time of day. Continuous measurements were collected using the Tynys mobile IoT device, which was bench-calibrated against a commercial reference sensor. Several machine learning models (logistic regression, decision tree, XGBoost, and random forest) were trained on synchronized environmental and occupancy data, with the XGBoost model achieving the highest predictive accuracy at 91.25%. Our analysis confirms that passenger occupancy is the primary driver of in-cabin pollution and that these machine learning models effectively capture the nonlinear relationships among environmental variables. Since the surveyed routes serve Almaty's most densely populated districts, improving the ventilation on these lines is of immediate importance to public health. Furthermore, the high-temporal-resolution data revealed short-term pollution spikes that correspond with peak ridership, advancing the current understanding of exposure risks in transit.

      "description": "Sensors (Basel). 2025 Jul 21;25(14):4520. doi: 10.3390/s25144520.ABSTRACTThe global prevalence of depression necessitates the application of technological solutions, particularly sensor-based systems, to augment scarce resources for early diagnostic purposes. In this study, we use benchmark datasets that contain multimodal data including video, audio, and transcribed text. To address depression detection as a chronic long-term disorder reflected by temporal behavioral patterns, we propose a novel framework that segments videos into utterance-level instances using GRU for contextual representation, and then constructs graphs where utterance embeddings serve as nodes connected through dual relationships capturing both chronological development and intermittent relevant information. Graph neural networks are employed to learn multi-dimensional edge relationships and align multimodal representations across different temporal dependencies. Our approach achieves superior performance with an MAE of 5.25 and RMSE of 6.75 on AVEC2014, and CCC of 0.554 and RMSE of 4.61 on AVEC2019, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods that focus primarily on momentary expressions.PMID:40732646 | DOI:10.3390/s25144520",

Existing infrastructure (e.g., blind lanes) and traditional aids (e.g., walking sticks, basic audio feedback) provide limited flexibility and interactivity for complex environments. To solve this problem, we propose a real-time travel assistance system based on deep learning. The hardware comprises an NVIDIA Jetson Nano controller, an Intel D435i depth camera for environmental sensing, and SG90 servo motors for feedback. To address embedded device computational constraints, we developed a lightweight object detection and segmentation algorithm. Key innovations include a multi-scale attention feature extraction backbone, a dual-stream fusion module incorporating the Mamba architecture, and adaptive context-aware detection/segmentation heads. This design ensures high computational efficiency and real-time performance. The system workflow is as follows: (1) the D435i captures real-time environmental data; (2) the processor analyzes this data, converting obstacle distances and path deviations into electrical signals; (3) servo motors deliver vibratory feedback for guidance and alerts. Preliminary tests confirm that the system can effectively detect obstacles and correct path deviations in real time, suggesting its potential to assist BVI users. However, as this is a work in progress, comprehensive field trials with BVI participants are required to fully validate its efficacy.PMID:40732644 | DOI:10.3390/s25144518",

Although both contact and non-contact sensing modalities are utilized, wearable devices with embedded sensors (e.g., accelerometers, pressure sensors) offer unique advantages through continuous data streams that enhance behavioral traceability. Focusing specifically on contact sensing techniques, this review examines sensor characteristics and data acquisition challenges, methodologies for processing behavioral data and implementing identification algorithms, industrial applications enabled by recognition outcomes, and prevailing challenges with emerging research opportunities. Current behavior classification relies predominantly on traditional machine learning or deep learning approaches with high-frequency data acquisition. The fundamental limitation restricting advancement in this field is the difficulty in maintaining high-fidelity recognition performance at reduced acquisition rates, particularly for integrated multi-behavior identification. Considering that the computational demands and limited adaptability to complex field environments remain significant constraints, Tiny Machine Learning (Tiny ML) could present opportunities to guide future research toward practical, scalable behavioral monitoring solutions.

Wrist-worn devices present a substantial opportunity for continuous movement recording and the supportive identification of these dyskinesias. To bridge the gap between dyskinesia assessment and machine learning-enabled detection, the recorded information requires meaningful data representations. This study evaluates and compares two distinct representations of sensor data: a task-dependent, semantically grounded approach and automatically extracted large-scale time-series features. Each representation was assessed on public datasets to identify the best-performing machine learning model and subsequently applied to our own collected dataset to assess generalizability. Data representations incorporating semantic knowledge demonstrated comparable or superior performance to reported works, with peak F1 scores of 0.68. Generalization to our own dataset from clinical practice resulted in an observed F1 score of 0.53 using both setups. These results highlight the potential of semantic movement data analysis for dyskinesia detection. Dimensionality reduction in accelerometer-based movement data positively impacts performance, and models trained with semantically obtained features avoid overfitting. Expanding cohorts with standardized neurological assessments labeled by medical experts is essential for further improvements.PMID:40732642 | DOI:10.3390/s25144514",

By leveraging diverse data sources, VisionTrack improves prediction accuracy and offers a more comprehensive assessment of retinal health. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this hybrid system, highlighting its potential for early detection, risk assessment, and personalized ophthalmic care.

Conventional approaches, however, struggle in complex industrial environments characterized by high noise, data incompleteness, and class imbalance. This study proposes an innovative Advanced CNN-BiLSTM architecture integrating multi-scale feature extraction with hierarchical attention to enhance PV fault detection. The proposed framework employs four parallel CNN branches with kernel sizes of 3, 7, 15, and 31 to capture temporal patterns across various time scales. These features are then integrated by an adaptive feature fusion network that utilizes multi-head attention. A two-layer bidirectional LSTM with temporal attention mechanism processes the fused features for final classification. Comprehensive evaluation on the GPVS-Faults dataset using a progressive difficulty validation framework demonstrates exceptional performance improvements. Under extreme industrial conditions, the proposed method achieves 83.25% accuracy, representing a substantial 119.48% relative improvement over baseline CNN-BiLSTM (37.93%). Ablation studies reveal that the multi-scale CNN contributes 28.0% of the total performance improvement, while adaptive feature fusion accounts for 22.0%. Furthermore, the proposed method demonstrates superior robustness under severe noise (σ = 0.20), high levels of missing data (15%), and significant outlier contamination (8%).

The merging of accessible and affordable sensors such as inertial measurement units (IMUs) and advanced machine learning techniques now enables gait assessment beyond traditional laboratory settings. A total of 52 participants walked at three speeds while carrying a smartphone-sized IMU in natural positions (hand, trouser pocket, or jacket pocket). A previously trained Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM)-based machine learning model predicted gait events, which were then used to calculate stride time, stance time, swing time, and double support time. Stride time predictions were highly accurate (<5% error), while stance and swing times exhibited moderate variability and double support time showed the highest errors (>20%). Despite these variations, moderate-to-strong correlations between the predicted and experimental spatiotemporal gait parameters suggest the feasibility of IMU-based gait tracking in real-world settings. These associations preserved inter-subject patterns that are relevant for detecting gait disorders. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of extracting clinically relevant gait parameters using IMU data mimicking smartphone use, especially parameters with longer durations such as stride time. Robustness across sensor locations and walking speeds supports deep learning on single-IMU data as a viable tool for remote gait monitoring.PMID:40732598 | DOI:10.3390/s25144470",

Existing models often struggle to balance accuracy and lightweight architecture. This paper introduces ELS-YOLO, a lightweight object detection model tailored for low-light environments, built upon the YOLOv11s framework. ELS-YOLO features a re-parameterized backbone (ER-HGNetV2) with integrated Re-parameterized Convolution and Efficient Channel Attention mechanisms, a Lightweight Feature Selection Pyramid Network (LFSPN) for multi-scale object detection, and a Shared Convolution Separate Batch Normalization Head (SCSHead) to reduce computational complexity.

However, challenges such as the lack of domain-specific datasets and the complexity of athletes' movements continue to hinder progress in this area. To address these issues, we propose an enhanced pose estimation framework tailored to badminton players, built upon an improved YOLOv8-Pose architecture. In particular, we introduce an efficient local attention (ELA) mechanism that effectively captures fine-grained spatial dependencies and contextual information, thereby significantly improving the keypoint localization accuracy and overall pose estimation performance. To support this study, we construct a dedicated badminton pose dataset comprising 4000 manually annotated samples, captured using a Microsoft Kinect v2 camera. The raw data undergo careful processing and refinement through a combination of depth-assisted annotation and visual inspection to ensure high-quality ground truth keypoints. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth comparative analysis of multiple attention modules and their integration strategies within the network, offering generalizable insights to enhance pose estimation models in other sports domains. The experimental results show that the proposed ELA-enhanced YOLOv8-Pose model consistently achieves superior accuracy across multiple evaluation metrics, including the mean squared error (MSE), object keypoint similarity (OKS), and percentage of correct keypoints (PCK), highlighting its effectiveness and potential for broader applications in sports vision tasks.PMID:40732573 | DOI:10.3390/s25144446",

      "description": "Sensors (Basel). 2025 Jul 17;25(14):4444. doi: 10.3390/s25144444.ABSTRACTTransparency is a key requirement for some classes of robots, exoskeletons, and assistive devices (READs), where safe and efficient human-robot interaction is crucial. Typical fields that require transparency are rehabilitation and industrial contexts. However, the definitions of transparency adopted in the literature are heterogeneous. It follows that there is a need to clarify, summarize, and assess how transparency is commonly defined and measured. Thus, the goal of this review is to systematically examine how transparency is conceptualized and evaluated across studies. To this end, we performed a structured search across three major scientific databases. After a thorough screening process, 20 out of 400 identified articles were further examined and included in this review. Despite being recognized as a desirable and essential characteristic of READs in many domains of application, our findings reveal that transparency is still inconsistently defined and evaluated, which limits comparability across studies and hinders the development of standardized evaluation frameworks. Indeed, our screening found significant heterogeneity in both terminology and evaluation methods. The majority of the studies used either a mechanical or a kinematic definition, mostly focusing on the intrinsic behavior of the device and frequently giving little attention to the device impact of the user and on the user's perception. Furthermore, user-centered or physiological assessments could be examined further, since evaluation metrics are usually based on kinematic and robot mechanical metrics. Only a few studies have examined the underlying motor control strategies, using more in-depth methods such as muscle synergy analysis. These findings highlight the need for a shared taxonomy and a standardized framework for transparency evaluation. Such efforts would enable more reliable comparisons between studies and support the development of more effective and user-centered READs.PMID:40732572 | DOI:10.3390/s25144444",

In clinical practice, nurses strictly adhere to regular repositioning protocols to prevent peripheral circulatory failure, during which the skin condition is evaluated visually. In this study, skin colour changes resulting from pressure application were continuously captured using a camera, and supervised machine learning was employed to classify the data into two categories: before and after pressure. The evaluation of practical colour space components revealed that the h component of the JCh colour space demonstrated the highest discriminative performance (Area Under the Curve (AUC) = 0.88), followed by the a* component of the CIELAB colour space (AUC = 0.84) and the H component of the HSV colour space (AUC = 0.83).

This practice, driven by the high cost of Wagyu and the affordability of fat-injected beef, has led to the proliferation of mislabeled \"Wagyu-grade\" products sold at premium prices, posing potential food safety risks such as allergen exposure or consumption of unverified additives, which can adversely affect consumer health. Addressing this, this study introduces a smart sensing system integrated with handheld mobile devices, enabling consumers to capture beef images during purchase for real-time health-focused assessment. The system analyzes surface texture and color, transmitting data to a server for classification to determine if the beef is artificially marbled, thus supporting informed dietary choices and reducing health risks. Images are processed by applying a region of interest (ROI) mask to remove background noise, followed by partitioning into grid blocks. Local binary pattern (LBP) texture features and RGB color features are extracted from these blocks to characterize surface properties of three beef types (Wagyu, regular, and fat-injected). A support vector machine (SVM) model classifies the blocks, with the final image classification determined via majority voting. Experimental results reveal that the system achieves a recall rate of 95.00% for fat-injected beef, a misjudgment rate of 1.67% for non-fat-injected beef, a correct classification rate (CR) of 93.89%, and an F1-score of 95.80%, demonstrating its potential as a human-centered healthcare tool for ensuring food safety and transparency.PMID:40732567 | DOI:10.3390/s25144440",

This has led to the emergence of many research works that focus on automating and streamlining the assessment of food quality. Electronic noses have become of paramount importance in this context. We analyze the current state of research in the development of electronic noses for food quality and safety. We examined research papers published in three different scientific databases in the last decade, leading to a comprehensive review of the field. Our review found that most of the efforts use portable, low-cost electronic noses, coupled with pattern recognition algorithms, for evaluating the quality levels in certain well-defined food classes, reaching accuracies exceeding 90% in most cases. Despite these encouraging results, key challenges remain, particularly in diversifying the sensor response across complex substances, improving odor differentiation, compensating for sensor drift, and ensuring real-world reliability. These limitations indicate that a complete device mimicking the flexibility and selectivity of the human olfactory system is not yet available. To address these gaps, our review recommends solutions such as the adoption of adaptive machine learning models to reduce calibration needs and enhance drift resilience and the implementation of standardized protocols for data acquisition and model validation. We introduce benchmark comparisons and a future roadmap for electronic noses that demonstrate their potential to evolve from controlled studies to scalable industrial applications. In doing so, this review aims not only to assess the state of the field but also to support its transition toward more robust, interpretable, and field-ready electronic nose technologies.PMID:40732564 | DOI:10.3390/s25144437",

Recognizing the time-dependent nature of bee behavior, we aimed to establish a baseline diurnal pattern recognition method. A custom apparatus enabled simultaneous audio acquisition from internal (brood frame, protected from propolization) and external hive locations. Sound signals were preprocessed using Power Spectral Density (PSD). Extra Trees and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifiers were trained to identify diurnal activity patterns. Analysis focused on feature importance, particularly spectral characteristics. Interestingly, Extra Trees performance varied significantly. While achieving near-perfect accuracy (98-99%) with internal recordings, its accuracy was considerably lower (61-72%) with external recordings, even lower than CNNs trained on the same data (76-87%). Further investigation using Extra Trees and feature selection methods using Mean Decrease Impurity (MDI) and Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) revealed the importance of the 100-600 Hz band, with peaks around 100 Hz and 300 Hz.

Specifically, an improved wild horse optimizer (IWHO) with tent chaotic mapping is employed to automatically optimize critical VMD parameters, including the number of modes K and the penalty factor α, enabling precise decomposition of non-stationary signals to extract weak fault features. The vibration signal is decomposed, and the top five intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) are selected based on the kurtosis criterion. Time-frequency features are then extracted from these IMFs and input into a modified GoogLeNet classifier. The GoogLeNet structure is improved by replacing standard n × n convolution kernels with cascaded 1 × n and n × 1 kernels, and by substituting the ReLU activation function with a parameterized TReLU function to enhance adaptability and convergence. Experimental results on two public rolling bearing datasets demonstrate that the proposed method effectively handles non-stationary signals, achieving 99.17% accuracy across four fault types and maintaining over 95.80% accuracy under noisy conditions.PMID:40732549 | DOI:10.3390/s25144421",

This study systematically compared three dynamic neural network architectures-Finite Impulse Response Neural Network (FIRNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-to examine their suitability and specificity for HAR tasks. A controlled experimental setup was applied, training 16,500 models across different delay lengths and hidden neuron counts.

To improve model transparency, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) was applied to both input and hidden layers. The results showed that gyroscope Y-axis data was consistently the most informative, while accelerometer Y-axis data was the least informative.

This review systematically classifies and evaluates current termite detection techniques in the context of embankment maintenance, focusing on physical sensing technologies and biological characteristic-based methods. Physical sensing methods enable non-invasive localization of subsurface anomalies, including ground-penetrating radar, acoustic detection, and electrical resistivity imaging.

However, suboptimal inhalation techniques, including inadequate airflow rates, have been a persistent concern for achieving effective therapeutic outcomes, as many patients remain unaware of their insufficient inhalation performance. As an effective strategy, a digital monitoring system, coupled with dry powder inhalers (DPIs), has emerged to estimate flow profiles and provide inhalation information. The estimation could be further facilitated by the application of artificial intelligence (AI). In this work, a novel digital system to primarily monitor pressure during DPI usage was successfully designed, and advanced machine learning (ML) techniques were then employed to estimate inhalation flow profiles based on the captured data. Four optimal machine learning models were selected for subsequent inhalation parameter prediction, given their superior generalization ability. By using these models, inhalation flow profiles could be successfully estimated, with an excellent accuracy of 97.7% for Peak Inspiratory Flow Rate (PIFR) and 95.2% for inspiratory capacity (IC). In summary, the pressure-based digital monitoring system empowered by AI techniques could be successfully applied to assess inhalation flow profiles with excellent accuracy.PMID:40732530 | DOI:10.3390/s25144402",

The algorithm enables estimation of spatiotemporal gait parameters such as cadence, stride length, loading response (LR), pre-swing (PSw), single limb support (SLS), double limb support (DLS), and swing phase and symmetry. Gait data were collected from 20 healthy individuals and 13 hemiparetic stroke patients. To reduce sensitivity to sensor orientation and suppress noise, sum vector magnitude (SVM) features were extracted and filtered using a second-order Butterworth low-pass filter at 3 Hz. A deep learning model was further compressed using knowledge distillation, reducing model size by 96% while preserving accuracy. The proposed method achieved error rates in event detection below 2% of the gait cycle for healthy gait and a maximum of 4.4% for patient gait in event detection, with corresponding parameter estimation errors also within 4%.
