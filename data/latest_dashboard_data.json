      "description": "Samsung has agreed a $16.5bn (£12.3bn) deal to manufacture artificial intelligence chips for Tesla, in a move hailed by Elon Musk on Monday. The South Korean tech company announced the contract with an unnamed client in a regulatory filing, with Tesla's chief executive giving further details on his social media platform, X. Musk wrote that Samsung would produce Tesla's next-generation A16 chips at a new plant in Texas. \"The strategic importance of this is hard to overstate,\" he wrote. The Guardian \n\nEthical hackers have shown Sky News how new age verification systems can be bypassed on pornographic websites in a matter of seconds. On Friday, toughened rules came into force that mean companies hosting adult content online must block under-18s using \"highly effective age verification\". But hours later, two ethical hackers working with the cyber training group The Hacking Games demonstrated just how simple it is to get around the measures designed to protect young people on the internet. Using widely available technology, Chris Kubecka and Paula Popovici quickly accessed numerous pornography sites without ever verifying their ages. Sky News \n\nA cyberattack on Russian state-owned flagship carrier Aeroflot caused a mass outage to the company's computer systems on Monday, Russia's prosecutor's office said, forcing the airline to cancel more than 100 flights and delay others. Ukrainian hacker group Silent Crow and Belarusian hacker activist group the Belarus Cyber-Partisans, which opposes the rule of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, claimed responsibility for the cyberattack. Images shared on social media showed hundreds of delayed passengers crowding Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, where Aeroflot is based.

The machines, developed by Dutch company Monumental, use two mechanical arms that dispense mortar and lay bricks at a similar pace to a human. That is equivalent to roughly 500 bricks per robot in a typical eight-hour shift, but they can be programmed to work around the clock if required – albeit under human supervision.

This new feature uses Apple Intelligence to analyze your workout data and deliver personalized voice feedback during exercise sessions. Instead of just tracking your stats silently, Workout Buddy acts like a personal trainer, offering motivation at the start of workouts, real-time updates on your performance, and encouraging summaries when you're done.

Ten million people within 98 miles of the epicentre could have been sent Google's highest level alert – giving up to 35 seconds of warning to find safety. Instead, only 469 \"Take Action\" warnings were sent out for the first 7.8 magnitude quake. Google told the BBC half a million people were sent a lower level warning, which is designed for \"light shaking\", and does not alert users in the same prominent way.

      "link": "http://ct.moreover.com/?a=57323857227&p=189&v=1&x=AAM24YV1bUL2pt6UVWeh7g",
      "description": "In the face of tariffs and economic uncertainty, investors remain optimistic for the global space economy's growth trajectory, with ramp-ups in defense spending and more nations making space capabilities a priority.\n\n\"Despite challenges in the financial markets and in the macro-economic situation, growth in the space economy continues at a super-exponential pace,\" says Chad Anderson, founder and CEO of Space Capital, who recently marked his fund's 10-year anniversary by ringing the bell at Nasdaq. \"The number of satellites in orbit is growing at a pace faster than Moore's Law, and that's creating an unprecedented amount of data that we're now unlocking and it's continuing to power the world's largest industries on Earth,\" Anderson adds.\n\nThe U.S. space industry, which accounts for 52 percent of the private market equity investment, according to Space Capital's Space IQ Q2 2025 report, continues to lead the world in the number of large funding deals this year.\n\nVia Satellite asked a number of global space fund managers and analysts to provide their view of the current funding climate.\n\nReturn of the IPO\n\nMike Collett, founder and managing partner for Promus Ventures, which focuses on investing in early-stage deep tech startups, says \"The fundraising climate for space companies for seed and Series A is still rather good. We continue to see high levels of space startup new rounds globally and expect this to continue.\"\n\nInvestors report a return to larger evaluations for growth-stage deals – series B and C, though Collett says those deals will \"require more traction and girth as has been the case over the last couple years.\"\n\n\"There have been 10 $100 million-plus funding rounds in the U.S. since the start of the year. We've seen two IPOs this year in the U.S.,\" says Filip Kocian, an investor for Expansion Aerospace Ventures, a seed-stage VC fund started last year in Paris. The fund currently has 137 million euros ($160 million) under management and 23 portfolio companies. \"The situation is quite different in Europe — We've only seen 15 space venture rounds this year in Europe. There are some big rounds brewing, which will become public later this year.\"\n\nRyan Puleo, a space investment analyst with BryceTech, points out that growth-stage deals show sustained volume and magnitude, with the amount invested in Series C deals in 2025 already exceeding the total for 2024. The analyst firm contends the number of American space firm public offerings is noteworthy, given that the only IPOs completed last year were for companies based in South Korea and Japan.\n\n\"This year has seen the return of the U.S. IPO,\" Puleo says.\n\nOne of the biggest U.S. IPOs was Voyager Technologies, which debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in June, with a valuation of $3.8 billion. The Denver-based defense and space firm, which was recently added to the U.S. Air Force's $46 billion agile acquisition contract, attracted double its asking share price, raising $382.8 million by selling nearly 12.4 million shares.\n\n\"There's definitely some level of over-exuberance in the market. There are folks who are overly backing certain business models,\" says Delian Asparouhov, who divides his time as a co-founder of Varda Space Industries and as a partner with Founders Fund, a VC fund formed in 2005, which today has $17 billion in assets under management.\n\nVarda just added its name to the list of large Series C rounds this year — announcing a $187 million round in mid-July.\n\nAsparouhov points to what he sees as an oversupply of bus and launch providers. \"People are expecting there to be 10 new winners in a given category, when it's really going to be three or four. You need to be big at this point,\" says Asparouhov.\n\nHe predicts that 80 percent of VC dollars will go to SpaceX and the remaining 20 percent will be distributed across three or four consolidated players with valuations in the range of $500 million to $2 billion.\n\nBetting on a few big winners is reflected in how investments have played out in Silicon Valley, says the investor and startup founder.\n\n\"We're seeing a K-shaped distribution, where 85 percent of venture dollars deployed last year in Silicon Valley went into 15 logos, which is the highest concentration it's ever been. You'll see the equivalent in space, where the number of dollars go up, but the number of logos funded go significantly down,\" Asparouhov says.\n\nU.S. Space Priorities: Golden Dome Boost Amid Deep NASA Cuts\n\nOne funding trend in the U.S. is clear: National defense space spending is growing as civil space programs are being slashed. At press time, the U.S. FY 2026 budget is going through Congress, but the White House requested $40 billion for the Space Force. In contrast, the Administration's proposed $18.8 billion budget for NASA pushes the space agency to its lowest level since 1961, when factoring inflation, and cuts nearly half of its science mission funding, or a third of NASA's science portfolio. However, there are indications that Congress will reject some of the cuts.\n\n\"We're headed toward a period of great uncertainty in the U.S. with regards to NASA's budget,\" says Carissa Christensen, founder and CEO of BryceTech. \"At the same time, there are growing national security budgets in the U.S., in Europe, in the U.K., in Japan. Satellite and launch capabilities are critical for national security, so that is going to shape the business and investment environment.\"\n\nOn the global space front, there's been significant international investment activity focused primarily in China and Europe.\n\n\"Companies focused on national security customers and technologies are among those raising the most funding, over $500 million has been raised by these companies so far in 2025,\" says BryceTech analyst Puleo.\n\nCollett observes that U.S. space investments continue to be stronger than EU spending, although he notes that more European defense-oriented space startups are emerging.\n\nGolden Dome, the Trump Administration's proposed multi-layered missile defense system, represents a major opportunity for space startups, investors agree.\n\nCollett points to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office that indicate the program could exceed $500 billion over the next 20 years. \"We believe the cuts to Space Launch Systems and Orion, among others, won't grossly change the continued support of space in the Trump administration,\" he predicts.\n\nChristensen says that while a surge of venture investment over the last decade has funded hundreds of startups, many of which have struggled to find customers. Golden Dome could potentially fill that void.\n\n\"We are seeing a shift toward national security customers partly because they have needs that commercial space capabilities map to and partly because they have the resources,\" says Christensen. \"Golden Dome falls exactly in that path — it's a customer with money and that has resources, and which needs the capabilities that commercial space companies can provide, whether that's launch, manufacturing, or space activities. So on both the demand and supply side, there's going to be a lot of energy and interest around Golden Dome.\"\n\nElon and Trump Effect: Europe Stepping Away from Starlink, Bolstering Space Defense\n\nAnderson notes that Elon Musk's involvement in the Trump Administration has prompted European space companies to turn away from Starlink services.\n\nThe Q2 2025 Space IQ report cites how geopolitical tensions are fueling more government and private spending Europe-wide. This includes NATO members pledging to raise defense budgets to 5 percent of GDP. The report further detailed how the European Commission's new Competitiveness Fund \"includes allocations for resilience, defense, and space – part of a broader push to reduce reliance on the U.S.\"\n\nAs a result, the second quarter showed more early-stage funding rounds for European startups across satellites, launch, stations and logistics. The fundraising was led by Germany, which accounted for 71 percent of capital raised. The report also points to France taking the lead in a new capital raise for Eutelsat Group, which operates Europe's competitor to Starlink, OneWeb. The U.K. government announced a move in mid-July to join the raise as well.\n\nAsparouhov, who is Bulgarian, sees upside for Eastern European space firms like EnduroSat. The Bulgarian satellite manufacturer recently raised 43 million euros ($50.25 million) in investment led by Founders Fund. In fact, he predicts it will be the largest winner in the aerospace sector in Europe, driven by the \"explosive demand for satellite components and avionics systems.\"\n\n\"The company has 70-plus percent margins and is profitable, which is unheard for a space company,\" he says, adding that the firm's supply chain includes building satellites from more traditional automotive and medical device supply chains versus aerospace component providers that rely largely on aerospace supply chains, which are much lower volume and higher cost.\n\nAnderson says while \"there's definitely a shift in perception that there's going to be a larger opportunity in Europe,\" it won't happen overnight since 80 percent of the EU's military hardware is still imported mostly from the U.S. \"European nations will need time to build out entirely new supply chain capabilities, he explains.\n\nMore Industry Consolidation, Collaboration Expected\n\nMany investment experts anticipate significant space industry consolidation over the next couple of years. Space Capital's Q2 analysis points to SES's acquisition of Intelsat \"that will create a multi-orbit operator with enhanced Geostationary Orbit (GEO) and Medium-Earth Orbit (MEO) capabilities to challenge Starlink and Amazon's Kuiper.\"\n\nAparouhov cited Rocket Lab's success growing its business through consolidation as a key market growth strategy that will continue. \"You'll see these kinds of mergers accelerate where sharks will eat up a bunch of minnows or minnows will merge.\"\n\nExpansion General Partner Charles Beigbeder says he's already seeing tough competition occurring as Europe's space markets open up for space tech entrepreneurs.\n\n\"Due to growing defense budgets, the big guys are coming back,\" he says. \"These smaller, middle-tier primes will both compete and collaborate.\"\n\nChanging procurement rules are incentivizing big companies to incorporate smaller firms into contracts. The smaller firms need the bigger players for their government go-to-market strategies.\n\n\"They've started to demonstrate they can deliver space hardware at scale, so the bigger players are more willing to play with the smaller companies,\" adds Kocian.\n\nCapability Gaps and Human Capital: Differentiators in 2025\n\nA key strategy for Expansion, which specializes in supporting European startups from seed-stage, is to identify where there are capability gaps between U.S. and existing European ventures and to invest in those solutions through partners in the research community.\n\n\"There are a few technologies missing in Europe – one is Positioning Navigation and Timing, or PNT,\" Kocian says, noting that globally, there is a growing recognition of the need for PNT solutions in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) to enhance resilience and security of critical infrastructure.\n\n\"While the U.S. has made a clear policy that they will support a commercial LEO PNT solution, Europe currently has taken a more traditional consortia approach,\" says Kocian.\n\nEurope is funding two LEO-PNT in-orbit demonstrators – one led by GMV Aerospace and Defence S.A.U., the other by Thales Alenia Space France S.A.S. The two consortia involve over 50 entities from 14 countries, including industrial actors with a long heritage in space, together with new actors following novel approaches to space.\n\n\"Although those are only demonstration missions, I'd argue that…positioning as an early anchor customer of commercial solutions would be a better approach,\" he says.\n\nWhile missile defense and technologies like LEO-PNT are important, Anderson remains bullish on satellite infrastructure. The Space Capital chief executive says that SpaceX making launch affordable removed barriers to entry for space startups and enabled the launch of affordable payloads with new capabilities. But in his view, the industry went too far down the low-cost cubesat route.\n\n\"Now, we've swung back into a place where people are building really interesting satellites with really interesting sensors that are providing extremely valuable data for these markets,\" he says.\n\nAnderson sees one of the biggest areas of opportunity for investors is in geospatial Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\n\"We've got much more capable, interesting infrastructure being launched, which is enabling all types of new applications and solutions for end markets, driven by the huge archive of data that goes back decades from Earth observation satellites,\" he says.\n\nAs investors look to the next year and which companies will come out on top, they all agree that funding is tight and cool technology isn't enough. The paramount consideration for whether companies get funded comes down to one factor: the people leading the business and communicating their technology's use case to investors.\n\n\"Ultimately, the make-or-break often comes down to the strength and execution capability of the team,\" says Anderson.

      "description": "The viral Brazilian song \"Predador de Perereca\" by BLOW RECORDS has sparked shocked reactions from TikTok users who have translated its lyrics from Portuguese to English and discovered its lewd subject matter.\n\nThe song was released on streaming platforms last month and has made shock waves on the Brazilian internet. When Americans and Europeans caught on, many were blissfully unaware of what the MC was actually saying. When they played it for their Brazilian friends, their reactions were priceless.\n\nSo, what is the song \"Predador de Perereca\" by BLOW RECORDS? Was it generated using AI and what are the English translated lyrics? Let's explain.\n\nWhat Is The Song 'Predador De Perereca' By BLOW RECORDS?\n\n\"Predador de Perereca (1982)\" is a remix of the 2015 song, \"Predador de Perereca\" by MC Jhey. The original was quite popular 10 years ago, as its music video has amassed over 26 million views since then.\n\nThe new remix, created by the artist BLOW RECORDS, was generated with an AI Music software, which turned the baile tune into a 1980s pop hit.\n\nIt was originally posted to YouTube in early June and has gained over 3 million views since then. BLOW RECORDS also posted snippets to TikTok and Instagram soon after, using AI-generated videos of frogs disco dancing.\n\nWhat Are The English Translated Lyrics Of 'Predador De Perereca?'\n\nAt first, many English speakers had no idea what the earworm was about. They'd soon learn that the song was about two boys from the favela having their way with a Czech girl in a sort of 2 man situation.\n\nThe lyrics of the song in Portuguese were added to Genius shortly after the song's release on streaming. With the help of Google Translate, the song's lyrics roughly translate in English to read:\n\nThis princess's smile is spectacular.\nIt's impressive when I drag her into a fight.\nShe doesn't invite her friends, she can handle it alone.\nShe sits for three, she sucks three more, then.\n(She sucks three more, then. She sucks three more, then. She sucks three more, then. She sucks three more, then.)\n\nYou, me, we put her on.\nThe gang has arrived, it's the frog predators.\nNaughty little pussy, share this Czech girl.\nGo sit down hard for the favela boys, then.\n\nYou, me, we put her on.\nThe gang has arrived, it's the frog predators.\nNaughty little pussy, share this Czech girl.\nGo sit down hard for the favela boys, then. (Go)\n\nYou, me, we put her on.\nThe gang has arrived, it's the frog predators.\nNaughty little pussy, share this Czech girl.\nGo sit down hard for the favela boys, then. … The gang has arrived, it's the frog predators.\nYou naughty little girl, share this Czech girl.\nGo sit down hard for the favela boys, then.\n\nThis princess's smile is spectacular.\nIt's impressive when I drag her into a fight.\nShe doesn't invite her friends, she's the only one who can handle it.\nShe sits down for three, she sucks three more, then.\n(She sucks three more, then.

She sucks three more, then.)\n\nYou, me, we put her on.\nThe gang has arrived, it's the frog predators.\nYou naughty little girl, share this Czech girl.\nGo sit down hard for the favela boys, then. (Go)\n\nYou, me, we put her on.\nThe gang has arrived, it's the frog predators.\nYou naughty little girl, share this Czech girl.\nGo sit down hard for the favela boys, then. (Go)\n\nYou, me, we put her on.\nThe gang has arrived, it's the frog predators. frog\nNaughty little pussy, share this Czech girl\nGo sit down hard for the favela boys, then\n(Go)\n\n(Go) me, you, we put it in\nThe gang has arrived, it's the frog predators\nNaughty little pussy, share this Czech girl\nGo sit down hard for the favela boys, then\n\nHow Is 'Predador De Perereca' Being Used On TikTok?\n\nAt first, it was only Brazilian and Portuguese-speaking internet users who were reacting to the song. Many of these early reactions were based on nostalgia because, as stated, MC Jhey's \"Predador de Perereca\" was huge back in 2015, so hearing it again, through an '80s sonic filter, was amusing.\n\nLater, the joke pivoted when non-Brazilian listeners naively fell victim to the song's catchiness. People who understood the lyrics used their ignorance as a memetic punchline.\n\nIn one video, TikToker @llegsdg joked about a \"POV\" situation in which, \"Your gringo friend shows you this Brazilian song he found.\" The TikToker is seen in the video urging his American friend to turn it off.\n\n@llegsdg Bro who showed you this!?!? TURN IT OFF  #brazilianmusic #gringo #brazilian #musicabrasileira # ♬ Predador de Perereca – BLOW RECORDS & Mc Jhey\n\nEnglish speakers then co-opted the joke in recent weeks. \"I looked up the lyrics to this song because it sounded fire,\" wrote TikToker @1proxisol in his own viral video. He's seen giving the viewer the Thousand Yard Stare, obviously paralyzed by his research.\n\n\"Brazil, what is up with y'all?\" he asked in the video's description.\n\n@1proxisol Brazil, what is up with y'all? #brazil #brazil #fypage ♬ Predador de Perereca – BLOW RECORDS & Mc Jhey\n\nWhat Are Some More 'Predador De Perereca' Memes?\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/embed/v2/7522836745960934661 https://www.tiktok.com/embed/v2/7522636115514346757\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/embed/v2/7523655598106348856 https://www.tiktok.com/embed/v2/7522175905620430093\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/embed/v2/7519937181360688414 https://www.tiktok.com/embed/v2/7530793928765738254\n\nFor the full history of \"Predador de Perereca\" by BLOW RECORDS, be sure to check out Know Your Meme's entry for even more information.",

      "description": "Coco's robots and Checkmate's frictionless POS integration on Uber Eats are helping White Castle deliver faster, smoother, and more efficiently <p> CHICAGO July 28,</p> <p>2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Coco Robotics, the world's</p> <p>leading urban robot delivery platform, today announced a new</p> <p>partnership with White Castle to launch autonomous deliveries via</p> <p>Uber Eats starting in Chicago . This is the 101-year-old restaurant's</p> <p>first deployment of robotic delivery, building on Coco's growing</p> <p>footprint across major U.S. cities.</p> <p> The launch marks an important milestone in White Castle's</p> <p>exploration of autonomous delivery. By integrating Coco's</p> <p>zero-emission delivery robots into the Uber Eats platform, the</p> <p>brand aims to streamline fulfillment, reduce parking lot</p> <p>congestion, and get food to customers faster - all without</p> <p>compromising quality or convenience.</p> <p> \"This partnership is about driving smarter operations where it</p> <p>matters most,\" said Chris Shaffery ,</p> <p>Vice President of Operations at White Castle. \"By testing Coco's</p> <p>robots at a high-traffic location, we're seeking to ease</p> <p>congestion, speed up service, and allow our team to stay focused on</p> <p>quality - helping us serve more customers, more efficiently.\"</p> <p> Coco's AI-powered robots are already a familiar sight in Chicago , having operated in the</p> <p>city since 2024. Designed for dense, urban environments, the</p> <p>company's compact delivery bots have safely completed over 500,000</p> <p>zero-emission deliveries across cities like Los Angeles Miami , and Helsinki . In Chicago , Coco's bots have proven themselves</p> <p>across snow, slush, and cracked sidewalks - earning praise for</p> <p>reliability, food quality, and winter performance.</p> <p> \"Coco is already completing hundreds of thousands of orders,</p> <p>proving that autonomous food delivery is scaling rapidly,\" said Melissa Fahs , Chief Commercial</p> <p>Officer at Coco Robotics. \"By expanding our footprint through</p> <p>partners like Uber Eats, we've unlocked opportunities with national</p> <p>brands such as White Castle - bringing autonomous delivery to a</p> <p>quick-service staple that's embracing technology to keep up with</p> <p>demand in high-traffic locations.\"</p> <p> Checkmate powers the real-time sync between White Castle's menu,</p> <p>Uber Eats, and the in-store POS - ensuring seamless order flow and</p> <p>fulfillment.

      "description": "In our fast-paced world, I have been drawn to health, technology, and the environment. They might appear to be completely different conversations on the surface in our normal life. <p>But if you look deeper, actually they form a triangle that connects together and holds a key to our personal and global future. This is why I'm writing about them. Because of this, I think you should also care.</p> <p> Let's start with health.</p> <p> Stress, screen exhaustion, air pollution, inactive routines, and, most recently, rising global temperatures put our bodies and minds under constant stress.</p> <p> However, at the same time, we have access to as many tools to control our health. The way we manage our health is being transformed by technology, whether it's through apps that help us eat, breathe, and sleep better or smartwatches that monitor our heartbeats.</p> <p> The healthcare industry is developing at a rate never before seen. In the field of health care, the convergence of human expertise and artificial intelligence marks a turning point .where innovation transforms how we provide and receive medical care and where technology bridges the gap between prevention and treatment.</p> <p> But now, for us, the challenge is using these tools mindfully without becoming even more glued to screens or overwhelmed by data.</p> <p> The main question is : Can we use tech to support health, not to replace it ..</p> <p> T echnology is the tool, not the enemy. Technology gets unfairly criticised sometimes, but it's justified. Technology is addictive; it can keep us apart. It pollutes. But stop, let's turn the side of the lens for a second.</p> <p> Cancer is being detected earlier with the help of AI. Robots are helping during surgeries; because of this, we are able to perform better. Apps have made therapy more accessible than ever before.</p> <p> And outside of the clinic? Smart devices are helping farmers conserve water; even in our homes, we can take care of our plants by using AI plant detector apps. Cities are reducing waste with AI. Solar and wind tech are creating clean energy solutions that didn't exist 20 years ago.</p> <p> Tech can fill in the gaps when it is constructed with ethics and empathy. It can heal. It can safeguard.</p> <p> Changes in the climate are not a remote threat.</p> <p> It exists.</p> <p> Climate change is affecting everything from the environment to our mental health to food. But here's the hopeful part: many people are aware, more solutions are emerging, and more voices are rising.</p> <p> Climate models that warn us years in advance are now available. We have satellites that are constantly following deforestation. We have entire platforms devoted to environmentally responsible living. The issue is not whether or not we intend to use the tools. But the real problem is a sick planet equals sick people. What affects the Earth directly affects us, whether it's poor air quality, a lack of water, or rising temperatures.</p> <p> So I believe the small conscious steps can help to build a more livable and happy life in the future.</p> <p> The future is being written right now—by our habits, our behavior's, our choices, and the stories we tell.</p> <p> By writing about health, tech, and the planet, I'm hoping that from now on, you start thinking about your daily life routine to spark the curiosity, awareness, and maybe even action. These are more than just news cycles or trends or the daily gossip. The foundations upon which we live, breathe, thrive, and survive are these. You don't have to be an activist, a leader, a journalist, a tech entrepreneur, or a scientist. You just need to care about your loved ones. Change little things.</p> <p> Vote for your preferred future. Because when we care about our health, we end up caring about our world. And when we care about our world, we build a future worth living in.</p> <p> This is only the start. I appreciate you reading my first post. In the coming weeks, I will delve deeper into the stories, tools, and individuals that are determining the future of wellness, innovation, sustainability, and a variety of other topics. Follow along if this resonates with you. Together, let's learn, ask questions, and develop.</p>",

      "description": "A new autonomous system developed at MIT is dramatically accelerating the identification of optimal polymer blends, potentially leading to breakthroughs in materials science with applications ranging from batteries to drug delivery.\n\nThe quest for novel materials is often focused on polymers, but traditional research methods are time-consuming and expensive. Rather than starting from scratch, scientists frequently blend existing polymers to achieve desired properties. However, identifying the best combination is a formidable challenge, hampered by a virtually limitless number of possibilities and the complex interactions between polymers. To overcome these hurdles, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have created a fully autonomous experimental platform capable of efficiently pinpointing optimal polymer blends.\n\nClosing the Loop on Materials Discovery\n\nThe innovative workflow centers around a powerful algorithm that systematically explores a vast range of potential polymer blends. This algorithm directs a robotic system to precisely mix chemical combinations and rigorously test their properties. Crucially, the system operates in a closed loop: results from each experiment inform the algorithm's next move, iteratively refining the search until the desired material characteristics are achieved.\n\nDuring testing, the platform autonomously identified hundreds of blends that surpassed the performance of their individual component polymers. A particularly intriguing finding emerged – the most effective blends didn't necessarily rely on the highest-performing individual polymers.\n\n\"I found that to be good confirmation of the value of using an optimization algorithm that considers the full design space at the same time,\" explained Connor Coley, the Class of 1957 Career Development Assistant Professor in the MIT departments of Chemical Engineering and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and senior author of the research. \"If you consider the full formulation space, you can potentially find new or better properties. Using a different approach, you could easily overlook the underperforming components that happen to be the important parts of the best blend.\"\n\nExpanding the Horizon of Material Applications\n\nThis breakthrough has the potential to unlock advancements across numerous fields. Potential applications include improved battery electrolytes, more cost-effective solar panels, and the development of tailored nanoparticles for safer and more effective drug delivery. The research team, which includes lead author Guangqi Wu, Tianyi Jin, and Alfredo Alexander-Katz, believes this is just the beginning.\n\nThe Challenge of a Vast Design Space\n\nDesigning new polymer blends presents scientists with a nearly insurmountable challenge: an endless array of potential polymers to consider. Even after selecting a few candidates, determining the optimal composition and concentration of each polymer within the blend adds another layer of complexity.\n\n\"Having that large of a design space necessitates algorithmic solutions and higher-throughput workflows because you simply couldn't test all the combinations using brute force,\" Coley added. While autonomous workflows have been explored for single polymers, the dramatically larger design space of polymer blends has remained largely unaddressed – until now.\n\nGenetic Algorithms and Robotic Precision\n\nThe MIT team focused on identifying new random heteropolymer blends, created by combining two or more polymers with differing structural features. These versatile polymers are particularly promising for high-temperature enzymatic catalysis, a process that accelerates chemical reactions.\n\nThe system's algorithm initially attempted to predict blend performance using machine learning, but the sheer scale of possibilities proved too vast for accurate predictions. Instead, the researchers turned to a genetic algorithm, inspired by biological processes like selection and mutation, to iteratively refine potential solutions. This algorithm encodes the composition of each blend into a \"digital chromosome,\" continuously improving it to identify the most promising combinations.\n\n\"This algorithm is not new, but we had to modify the algorithm to fit into our system. For instance, we had to limit the number of polymers that could be in one material to make discovery more efficient,\" Wu explained. The algorithm also balances exploration – searching for random polymers – with exploitation – optimizing the best polymers from previous experiments.\n\nThe algorithm directs the robotic platform to prepare and test 96 polymer blends at a time. Experiments focused on enhancing the thermal stability of enzymes by optimizing retained enzymatic activity (REA), a measure of enzyme stability after exposure to high temperatures. The resulting data is then fed back into the algorithm, driving the next iteration of blend creation and testing.\n\nAccelerating the Pace of Innovation\n\nBuilding the robotic system presented significant engineering challenges, including developing techniques for uniform polymer heating and optimizing the speed of liquid handling. \"In autonomous discovery platforms, we emphasize algorithmic innovations, but there are many detailed and subtle aspects of the procedure you have to validate before you can trust the information coming out of it,\" Coley noted.\n\nThe optimal blends identified by the system consistently outperformed their constituent polymers. The best blend achieved an REA of 73 percent, representing an 18 percent improvement over any of the individual components. \"This indicates that, instead of developing new polymers, we could sometimes blend existing polymers to design new materials that perform even better than individual polymers do,\" Wu stated.\n\nThe autonomous platform can currently generate and test 700 new polymer blends per day, requiring only human intervention for chemical refills. While this research centered on polymers for protein stabilization, the platform's versatility allows for adaptation to other applications, such as the development of new plastics or battery electrolytes. Future research will focus on refining the algorithm using experimental data and developing new algorithms to further streamline the autonomous liquid handler's operations.\n\nRelated",

(NYSE: NOV) today reported second quarter 2025 revenues of $2.19 billion, a decrease of one percent compared to the second quarter of 2024. Net income decreased 52 percent to $108 million, or $0.29 per share, and operating profit decreased 54 percent to $143 million, or 6.5 percent of sales. The decline in net income and operating profit is primarily attributed to a pre-tax gain of approximately $130 million on the sale of a business during the second quarter of 2024. The Company recorded $19 million within Other Items during the second quarter of 2025 (see Corporate Information for additional details). Adjusted EBITDA decreased 10 percent year-over-year to $252 million, or 11.5 percent of sales.\n\n\"Sales improved four percent sequentially, with an increase in capital equipment revenues more than offsetting a decline in spare part and product sales,\" said Clay Williams, Chairman and CEO. \"Macroeconomic uncertainty, the rapid unwinding of OPEC+ production quotas, and conflict in the Middle East led to greater caution among our customers, deferred orders, and lower year-over-year revenues. These market headwinds and a shift in sales mix pressured margins during the quarter.\n\n\"Customers in North America continued to trim oil-directed drilling, which was only partly offset by modestly increasing gas drilling. Offshore activity remains comparatively strong, despite certain project delays, and we remain encouraged by the steady application of unconventional technologies in new international basins. Overall, the softer market has made it more challenging to offset tariffs and other inflationary costs. In response, NOV is implementing additional cost control initiatives and further adjusting our global supply chain to better mitigate increasing costs.\n\n\"Looking ahead, we expect current market dynamics to persist resulting in lower industry activity levels through the second half of the year, with offshore activity resuming growth in 2026. Longer-term, we expect rising demand for secure, reliable, and lower-cost sources of energy will drive investment in our core markets. NOV's technology leadership, customer-focus, and commitment to improving efficiencies has the Company well positioned to navigate through the near-term environment while positioning the company for future growth.\"\n\nEnergy Products and Services\nEnergy Products and Services generated revenues of $1.03 billion in the second quarter of 2025, a decrease of two percent from the second quarter of 2024. Operating profit decreased $45 million from the prior year to $83 million, or 8.1 percent of sales, and included $6 million in Other Items. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $38 million from the prior year to $146 million, or 14.2 percent of sales. The decline in revenue was due to lower levels of global drilling activity affecting demand for the segment's shorter cycle consumable products, partially offset by higher sales from the segment's capital equipment offerings. Profitability was impacted by a less favorable sales mix, tariffs and other inflationary pressures, and certain charges in Latin America.\n\nEnergy Equipment\nEnergy Equipment generated revenues of $1.21 billion in the second quarter of 2025, flat when compared to the second quarter of 2024. Operating profit was $122 million, or 10.1 percent of sales, and included $9 million in Other Items. Operating profit decreased $110 million from the prior year primarily attributed to a pre-tax gain of approximately $130 million on the sale of a business during the second quarter of 2024. Adjusted EBITDA increased $16 million from the prior year to $158 million, or 13.1 percent of sales. Higher revenue out of backlog offset lower sales of aftermarket parts and services. Improved profitability was driven by strong execution on higher-margin backlog.\n\nNew orders totaled $420 million, a decrease of $557 million when compared to the $977 million of new orders booked during the second quarter of 2024. Orders shipped from backlog in the second quarter of 2025 were $632 million, representing a book-to-bill of 66 percent, compared to $553 million orders shipped and a book-to-bill of 177 percent in the second quarter of 2024. As of June 30, 2025, backlog for capital equipment orders for Energy Equipment was $4.30 billion, a decrease of $31 million from the second quarter of 2024.\n\nQ3 2025 Outlook\nThe Company is providing financial guidance for the third quarter of 2025, which constitutes \"forward-looking statements\" as described further below under \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\n\nFor the third quarter of 2025 management expects year-over-year consolidated revenues to decline between one to three percent with Adjusted EBITDA expected to be between $230 million and $250 million.\n\nCorporate Information\nNOV repurchased approximately 5.5 million shares of common stock for $69 million during the second quarter. Including a supplemental dividend of $0.21 per share and a regular dividend of $0.075 per share, NOV returned a total of $176 million in capital to shareholders during the quarter.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2025, NOV recorded $19 million in Other Items, primarily related to severance costs, facility closures and streamlining our business processes (see Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA).\n\nAs of June 30, 2025, the Company had total debt of $1.73 billion, with $1.50 billion available on its primary revolving credit facility, and $1.08 billion in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nSignificant Achievements\nNOV was awarded a multi-year contract to provide instrumentation and digital services across the US fleet of a major land drilling contractor. By standardizing data aggregation, delivery, and visualization, the contractor is reducing complexity while offering advanced digital capabilities to its customers. NOV's next-generation Electronic Drilling Recorder (EDR) and Remote Drilling Monitoring (RDM) applications, powered by the Max™ Platform, enable real-time insights and seamless collaboration from wellsite to office.\n\nNOV signed a contract to engineer and supply a monoethylene glycol (MEG) recovery system for a project in the Eastern Mediterranean.

Previously produced internationally, this product line now benefits from reduced freight costs and shorter lead times, helping NOV better serve operators in one of the most active energy regions in the US.\n\nNOV delivered advanced composite piping systems and underground diesel storage solutions for backup power generation at major data center facilities in New Jersey, Arizona, and North Dakota. These systems support critical operations at hyperscale data centers, including a flagship campus in North Dakota, which is expected to be the largest of its kind in the US. NOV's composite solutions are well positioned to support the growing need for data center infrastructure to support increasing demand for cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics.\n\nAn NOV-packed bottomhole assembly (BHA)—featuring the MONZA™ 40 drilling motor with a 7\" 5/6 8.2 ERT™ power section, NOV High Flow Agitator™ friction reduction tool, and a ReedHycalog™ 8¾\" Tektonic™ TKC63 fixed cutter bit—enabled operators to drill 5,200 ft in just 22.5 hours in the Eagle Ford Shale, setting a new 24-hour footage record. The BHA drilled both the curve and lateral sections while achieving an average rate of penetration (ROP) of 224.42 ft per hour. This performance milestone highlights how the integration of NOV technologies drives drilling efficiency, giving customers a single-source solution for high-performance BHAs that deliver results.\n\nNOV introduced its Agitator™X2 dual Agitator friction reduction technology featuring the NOV's AgitatorZP tool and AgitatorHE tool into Argentina's unconventional market during the quarter. In one deployment, the dual Agitator technology drilled a 3,500-m lateral in the Vaca Muerta formation, marking the longest lateral drilled in the field using a steerable motor assembly. The unique design of AgitatorZP tool allows the use of dual Agitator tools while maintaining the pressure drop of a single tool, delivering effective friction reduction without compromising hydraulic efficiency.\n\nNOV is advancing drilling performance in the Bakken with the release of ION+™ Intrepid 14.5 mm polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) cutters. Operators are breaking rate of penetration (ROP) records across 2-, 3-, and 4-mile production sections by maintaining cutter sharpness and minimizing sliding time. One operator achieved a record-low sliding time of just 2.5% through a 4-mile lateral, significantly reducing rig costs. In addition, NOV secured a multi-year drill bit contract to support the New Gas Consortium (NGC) Project offshore Angola. The agreement includes an initial order for advanced drill bits and positions NOV to support future deepwater campaigns in the region.\n\nNOV delivered an integrated package of coiled tubing units, nitrogen converters, pressure control equipment, injector heads, coiled tubing monitoring systems, and a coiled tubing lift frame to a leading multinational oilfield services company operating in Latin America. NOV continues to experience strong demand for its critical well intervention technologies in international markets.\n\nNOV is driving new standards in high-pressure/high-temperature (HP/HT) drilling performance. In South Texas and the Haynesville Shale, NOV's Tundra™ Max mud chiller has been deployed across several drilling campaigns, helping operators manage extreme downhole temperatures and reduce nonproductive time. To further enhance temperature control in long laterals, these projects also featured NOV's TK™-Drakon thermally insulating drill pipe coating, a next-generation solution delivering measurable gains in bottomhole circulating temperature, tool life, and rig time. In addition, Grant Prideco booked six strings of 4.5-in. Delta™ 425 drill pipe with TK-Drakon. With more than one million feet of TK-Drakon-coated pipe now in the field, and growing traction in the market, NOV is enabling operators to access deeper, hotter, more complex targets.\n\nSecond Quarter Earnings Conference Call\nNOV will hold a conference call to discuss its second quarter 2025 results on July 29, 2025 at 10:00 AM Central Time (11:00 AM Eastern Time). The call will be broadcast simultaneously at .

These non-GAAP financial measures are broadly used to value and compare companies in the oilfield services and equipment industry. Not all companies define these measures in the same way. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and should therefore be considered only as supplemental to such GAAP financial measures. Additionally, Free Cash Flow and Excess Free Cash Flow do not represent the Company's residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, as the calculation of these measures does not account for certain debt service requirements or other non-discretionary expenditures. Please see the attached schedules for reconciliations of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA. The Company has not provided a reconciliation of projected Adjusted EBITDA. Management cannot predict with a reasonable degree of accuracy certain of the necessary components of net income, such as other income (expense), which includes fluctuations in foreign currencies. As such, a reconciliation of projected net income to projected Adjusted EBITDA is not available without unreasonable effort. The actual amount of other income (expense), provision (benefit) for income taxes, equity income (loss) in unconsolidated affiliates, depreciation and amortization, and other amounts excluded from Adjusted EBITDA could have a significant impact on net income.\n\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis document contains, or has incorporated by reference, statements that are not historical facts, including estimates, projections, and statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results that are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

      "description": "Sean Plankey, the nominee to lead the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, glided through a relatively uncontroversial nomination hearing last week, but his path to confirmation in the Senate remains murky due to one senator's hold. \n \nPlankey testified alongside several other nominees before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee last week. Plankey is currently serving as a senior adviser at the Coast Guard while he awaits Senate confirmation. \n \nCommittee Ranking Member Gary Peters (D-Mich.) pressed Plankey on how he would ensure CISA fulfills its mission while facing steep workforce losses and budget cuts under the Trump administration . \n \nPlankey responded that he would \"allow the operators to operate.\" \n \n\"CISA has a number of the most capable cybersecurity people in the world,\" he said. \n \nIf confirmed, Plankey said he would focus particularly on protecting critical infrastructure, \"mom and pop small businesses\" and the federal civilian executive branch from cyberattacks. \n \n\"If that means we have to reorganize in some form or fashion, that's what we'll do. I'll lead that charge,\" Plankey said. \"And if that means that we need a different level of funding than we currently have now, then I will approach the secretary, ask for that funding, ask for that support.\" \n \nPlankey pointed to his experience working with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Donald Trump to increase funding for the Coast Guard amid major reforms. \n \nBut unlike the Coast Guard, Peters pointed out that there aren't any \"cyber protection reserves\" to back up CISA. \n \n\"I would hope that if confirmed, you're really focused on the resource needs and have the willingness to step up and tell folks, 'No, this is really important,'\" Peters said. \n \nPlankey also backed a congressional push to reauthorize the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015. The law's authorities expire at the end of September. \n \n\"If that was left to expire, in particular in the financial sector — who does some of the most prevalent amount of information sharing — they would experience difficulties in information sharing, in community protection of information security, and then other industries would as well,\" Plankey said. \n \nPlankey also said it would be a priority to address supply chain concerns, such as potential rogue communication devices in Chinese-made renewable energy infrastructure. \n \n\"If confirmed, it will be a priority of mine to remove all Chinese intrusions, exploitations or infestation in the American supply chain,\" Plankey said. \n \nPlankey is a former Energy Department and Coast Guard official who is widely supported for the CISA role by the cybersecurity community. \n \nFollowing the hearing, new House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.) called on the Senate to quickly confirm Plankey. \n \n\"Every minute without CISA's top leadership in place puts our security at risk and benefits nation-state sponsored cyber actors like Salt Typhoon,\" Garbarino said. \"I am committed to working with my House and Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle to dig deeper into that intrusion, which is essential for CISA to address in its role as the Sector Risk Management Agency for the communications sector.\" \n \nThe Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee is scheduled to vote on advancing Plankey's nomination on Wednesday. \n \nHowever, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) is holding Plankey's nomination on the Senate floor until CISA commits to releasing a report on cybersecurity weaknesses in U.S. telecommunications infrastructure. \n FEMA reforms  \nLast week, leaders on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee released their much-anticipated, bipartisan bill to reform the Federal Emergency Management Agency. \n \nThe \"FEMA Act\" would lift FEMA out of the Department of Homeland Security and make it an independent, cabinet-level agency. It would also make major reforms to FEMA's disaster assistant processes, with the changes aimed at streamlining both individual assistance and funding provided to state and local governments. \n \n\"This bill does more than any recent reforms to cut through the bureaucracy, streamline programs, provide flexibility, and return FEMA to its core purpose of empowering the states to lead and coordinating the federal response when it's needed,\" Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Sam Graves (R-Mo.) said in a statement. \n \nThe bill would also set up a task force to close out more than 1,000 disaster declarations dating back to Hurricane Katrina. And it would direct FEMA to develop a universal application for individual disaster assistance. \n \nThe Trump administration has also established a FEMA Review Council to recommend reforms to federal emergency management. The council's recommendations are due to the White House in November. \n TSA tech request  \nThe Transportation Security Administration, meanwhile, is reminding industry to respond by Aug. 1 to its request for information on \"turnkey\" airport screening solutions. \n \nThe RFI was released through TSA's Screening Partnership Program, which allows commercial airports to use private security screening companies under TSA's oversight. \n \nTSA's acting administrator previously told Congress that \"nothing is off the table\" regarding any potential privatization of the agency's screening functions. \n \nIn a notice, TSA told industry it's particularly interested in technology that can \"reduce reliance on manual labor,\" incorporate \"AI-driven threat detection and remote screening,\" improve the satisfaction of passengers, and \"increase adaptability during surge events or staffing constraints.\" \n \nTSA has already been experimenting with artificial intelligence to train and assist TSA airport screeners . \n\nThe post first appeared on Federal News Network .",

      "description": "Waste management services provider Waste Management WM beat Wall Street's revenue expectations in Q2 CY2025, with sales up 19% year on year to $6.43 billion. On the other hand, the company's full-year revenue guidance of $25.38 billion at the midpoint came in 0.5% below analysts' estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $1.92 per share was 1.6% above analysts' consensus estimates.\n\nIs now the time to buy Waste Management? Find out by accessing our full research report, it's free.\n\nWaste Management (WM) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $6.43 billion vs analyst estimates of $6.36 billion (19% year-on-year growth, 1.1% beat)\nAdjusted EPS: $1.92 vs analyst estimates of $1.89 (1.6% beat)\nAdjusted EBITDA: $1.92 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.87 billion (29.9% margin, 2.6% beat)\nEBITDA guidance for the full year is $7.55 billion at the midpoint, in line with analyst expectations\nOperating Margin: 17.9%, in line with the same quarter last year\nFree Cash Flow Margin: 11.1%, up from 9.8% in the same quarter last year\nMarket Capitalization: $92.42 billion\n\n\"As we described at our recent Investor Day, WM is building distinctive platforms to drive competitive differentiation and fuel a powerful, long-term growth engine to create shareholder value. Our second quarter results are a strong demonstration of our progress on all fronts,\" said Jim Fish, WM's CEO.\n\nCompany Overview\n\nHeadquartered in Houston, Waste Management WM is a provider of comprehensive waste management services in North America.\n\nRevenue Growth\n\nA company's long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Over the last five years, Waste Management grew its sales at a solid 9.7% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth beat the average industrials company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\n\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss new industry trends or demand cycles. Waste Management's annualized revenue growth of 9.4% over the last two years aligns with its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was predictably strong.\n\nThis quarter, Waste Management reported year-on-year revenue growth of 19%, and its $6.43 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street's estimates by 1.1%.\n\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 9.6% over the next 12 months, similar to its two-year rate. This projection is particularly healthy for a company of its scale and indicates the market is forecasting success for its products and services.\n\nUnless you've been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) stock benefiting from the rise of AI. Click here to access our free report one of our favorites growth stories.\n\nOperating Margin\n\nOperating margin is a key measure of profitability. Think of it as net income - the bottom line - excluding the impact of taxes and interest on debt, which are less connected to business fundamentals.\n\nWaste Management's operating margin might fluctuated slightly over the last 12 months but has generally stayed the same, averaging 17.4% over the last five years. This profitability was elite for an industrials business thanks to its efficient cost structure and economies of scale. This is seen in its fast historical revenue growth and healthy gross margin, which is why we look at all three data points together.\n\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, Waste Management's operating margin might fluctuated slightly but has generally stayed the same over the last five years. This raises questions about the company's expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability.\n\nIn Q2, Waste Management generated an operating margin profit margin of 17.9%, in line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company's cost structure has recently been stable.\n\nEarnings Per Share\n\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company's growth is profitable.\n\nWaste Management's solid 11.6% annual EPS growth over the last five years aligns with its revenue performance. This tells us it maintained its per-share profitability as it expanded.\n\nLike with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business.\n\nFor Waste Management, its two-year annual EPS growth of 13% was higher than its five-year trend. We love it when earnings growth accelerates, especially when it accelerates off an already high base.\n\nIn Q2, Waste Management reported EPS at $1.92, up from $1.82 in the same quarter last year. This print beat analysts' estimates by 1.6%. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Waste Management's full-year EPS of $7.25 to grow 11.7%.\n\nKey Takeaways from Waste Management's Q2 Results\n\nIt was encouraging to see Waste Management beat analysts' revenue, EPS, and EBITDA expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its full-year revenue guidance slightly missed. Overall, this print had some key positives. The stock remained flat at $229.25 immediately after reporting.\n\nBig picture, is Waste Management a buy here and now? If you're making that decision, you should consider the bigger picture of valuation, business qualities, as well as the latest earnings. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.",

      "description": "Wall Street traders left stocks at all-time highs while the dollar climbed the most since May, with a tariff deal between President Donald Trump and the European Union bolstering hopes for an extension of a China trade truce. Treasuries edged lower.\n\nThe start of a week that will set the tone for the rest of the year in markets saw a dollar gauge up nearly 1%. The euro slid the most in over two months. The S&P 500 briefly topped 6,400 to close little changed. Treasuries barely budged amid mixed results from U.S. debt sales. Oil rose as Trump said he'd shorten his timeline for Russia to reach a truce with Ukraine.\n\nIn the run-up to the Aug. 1 U.S. tariff deadline, traders will go through a raft of key data from jobs to inflation and economic activity. The big event comes Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve is expected to keep rates unchanged. Then there's a string of big-tech earnings, with four megacaps worth a combined $11.3 trillion reporting results.\n\n\"This is about as busy as a week can get in the markets,\" said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. \"This week could make or break that momentum in the near term.\"\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials finished the first of two days of talks aimed at extending their tariff truce beyond a mid-August deadline and hashing out ways to maintain trade ties while safeguarding economic security. Canada Prime Minister Mark Carney said his government is still deep in trade talks with the Trump administration.\n\nThe Treasury jacked up its estimate for federal borrowing for the current quarter to $1 trillion, mainly due to distortions from the debt limit. On Wednesday, the department will announce its plans for note and bond sales over coming months — which dealers widely see as staying unchanged.\n\nSpeaking in Scotland on Sunday to announce the EU deal, Trump gave a brief update on Washington's relations with Beijing. \"We're very close to a deal with China. We really sort of made a deal with China, but we'll see how that goes,\" he said without elaborating.\n\n\"It is possible that as more trade deals are announced, the level of uncertainty that has hovered over business and the economy will ease,\" said Brent Schutte at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co. \"Additionally, the impact of final trade deals could be less than originally forecast after the April 2 announcement of reciprocal tariffs.\"\n\nTo Thierry Wizman at Macquarie Group, while the dollar's strength today may reflect the perception that the new EU deal is lopsided in favor of the U.S., it may also reflect a feeling that America is reengaging with its major allies.\n\n\"Whether we agree or not with the use of tariffs and the deals announced, we are getting the big ones out of the way which will allow American businesses to adjust and plan, for better or worse,\" said Peter Boockvar at the Boock Report. \"And we can now focus on how this all plays out.\"\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues will step into the central bank's board room for a two-day meeting starting Tuesday to deliberate on rates at a time of immense political pressure, evolving trade policy, and economic cross-currents.\n\nIn a rare occurrence, policymakers will convene in the same week that the government issues reports on gross domestic product, employment and the Fed's preferred price metrics. Forecasters anticipate the heavy dose of data will show economic activity rebounded in the second quarter.\n\nWhile the stock market is moving sideways after a solid run, \"if we get no surprises in earnings and some dovish comments by the Fed, it's likely we'll see yet more new highs by the end of the week,\" said Louis Navellier, chief investment officer at Navellier & Associates.\n\n\"We do not expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates on Wednesday, but it's possible that they make a stronger signal that cuts are on the horizon in the fall, especially as the inflation data continues to stay muted even in this tariff environment,\" said Rick Gardner at RGA Investments.\n\nGardner also says that while stock market valuations are high, that in and of itself is not a reason why valuations can't expand even further from here.\n\nIn fact, this earnings season is off to a solid start, and all eyes will be on results from Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. on Wednesday, and Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. on Thursday.\n\nSo far, Corporate America appears to be taking tariffs in stride. With about a third of S&P 500 firms having reported, roughly 82% have beaten profit forecasts, on track for the best quarter in about four years, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show.\n\nProgress in trade negotiations will take the S&P 500 to a third consecutive year of 20% gains, according to Oppenheimer Asset Management's John Stoltzfus, a feat unseen since the late 1990s. He raised his year-end target for the U.S. benchmark to 7,100.\n\nSome market forecasters including Morgan Stanley's Michael Wilson have turned more optimistic about the S&P 500 as they expect earnings to remain upbeat.\n\nThe technical evidence suggests a broadening of participation in equities off the April low, according to Craig Johnson at Piper Sandler.\n\n\"Despite a slight easing in momentum as investors await earnings, the combination of several major indices at all-time highs and improving market breadth continues to draw investors off the sidelines, offering opportunities to buy the dip,\" he said.\n\nAt RBC Capital Markets, Lori Calvasina says it would be premature to write off the impact of tariffs on inflation and corporate earnings.\n\n\"It also poses a risk to the path of stock prices if company outlooks for 2026 don't end up being as rosy as investors have been anticipating,\" she noted.\n\nThe S&P 500 is trading around 22.5 times projected earnings, compared to a 10-year average of 18.6. That's sparked concerns that there may be little room for error.\n\nThe stock market's stunning rebound and resilience have again emboldened equity investors, who have developed muscle memory around 'buying the dip',\" according to Lisa Shalett at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.\n\n\"With volatility having decoupled from stress indicators, passive indexes have ground to new highs, while the most speculative corners of the market have begun to lead,\" she said. \"Complacency is elevated, and valuations are rich. In this environment, we want to be stock-pickers.\"\n\nTo Mark Hackett at Nationwide, this may be the most compelling intersection of technical momentum and fundamental strength we've seen in a long time.\n\n\"The S&P hasn't had a 1% move in over a month and yet bears have capitulated,\" he said. \"No one's willing to short this market, and even typically skeptical investors are getting pulled in. While it's not a blow-off top yet, the odds of that happening are rising.\"\n\nIf sentiment keeps shifting and dip buyers remain aggressive, we could see a classic melt-up – and any near-term weakness over the next several weeks is likely to be bought aggressively, he said.\n\n\"However, for now, bears are hibernating through the summer,\" Hackett concluded.\n\n\"We would lean toward being more bullish than bearish on U.S. stocks through year-end, but not outside of a balanced portfolio based on risk,\" said Anthony Saglimbene at Ameriprise. \"However, that view is contingent on positive corporate profitability and economic growth this year, avoiding worst-case tariff scenarios, and investors remaining willing to 'buy the dip'.\"\n\nMarkets have found reassurance in several developments, according to Invesco Global Market Strategy Office.\n\n\"For one, the worst fears that manifested around trade in early April haven't materialized, and key trade agreements are being signed,\" the strategists said. \"Tariff rates remain vastly elevated compared to last year, but they appear manageable. In our view, it's likely that the cost can be shared between businesses and consumers without a meaningful impact on growth or inflation.\"\n\nInvesco strategists also noted that what should really matter for stocks in the medium and long-term is earnings.\n\n\"After a strong market rally, investors should prepare for renewed volatility in the near term,\" said Mark Haefele at UBS Global Wealth Management. \"Potential market dips could offer an opportunity for investors to build long-term exposure to stocks.\"\n\nCorporate Highlights:\n\n—Samsung Electronics Co. will produce AI semiconductors for Tesla Inc. in a new $16.5 billion pact that marks a win for its underperforming foundry division.\n\n—Texas Instruments Inc. was upgraded to outperform at Wolfe Research, which said the chipmaker is \"near the end\" of a spending cycle.\n\n—Cisco Systems Inc. was downgraded to inline at Evercore, which mentioned valuation following recent gains.\n\n—Nike Inc. was raised to overweight at JPMorgan Chase & Co., which cited the earnings impact of the sportswear maker's five-pronged multi-year recovery plan.\n\n—Albertsons Cos. demanded that Kroger Co. provide details on personal conduct that led the company to replace its chief executive officer, who shepherded the failed $24.6 billion takeover that's now the focus of litigation between the two companies.\n\n—PayPal Holdings Inc. will soon allow businesses to accept more than one hundred cryptocurrencies at checkout.\n\n—Roche Holding AG plans to test whether an experimental medicine can prevent Alzheimer's disease symptoms in high-risk people, its latest investment in one of the most failure-prone areas of drugmaking.\n\n—Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Inc. said Monday that it's owed a $100 million milestone payment from Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. within the next two months, pressuring the beleaguered biotech company just days after it stopped selling its biggest drug due to safety concerns.\n\n—EssilorLuxottica SA posted better-than-expected revenue in the second quarter, as the world's biggest eyewear maker showed strong gains in Europe and pressed ahead with its smart-glasses initiative.\n\n—Warner Bros.

      "description": "As a child growing up in 1980's Ireland, Sinead Colton Grant didn't dream of a career in finance. Instead, her journey to the top ranks of Wall Street started with an unexpected monetary gain. She was a college student headed to Italy on a summer trip when she noticed a pleasant surprise in her finances. The devaluation of the currency just before she left, meant she had a little more Italian lira than she expected. For Colton Grant, this little holiday windfall sparked a lifelong fascination with global finance and smart investing, that would see her rise from FX sales on a London trading floor to become the first female Chief Investment Officer in BNY Mellon's Wealth Management history.\n\nHer role oversees key decisions at one of the world's largest private banks. But she shares, that for her, the numbers and portfolios have only ever been part of the story. \"Investment isn't just about returns,\" she says. \"It's about trust. Without trust, even the best strategies fall flat.\" While she crafts strategies for some of the world's wealthiest people and foundations, she's equally attuned to the changing face of wealth, who's wielding it and how that changing client profile makes trust more important than ever before.\n\nI sat down with Colton Grant to discuss her rise through the ranks of an industry where she has often been the only woman in the room, her take on the current investment landscape and how she is witnessing and championing a historic shift in who holds financial power.\n\nFrom Dublin to Wall Street: A Global Journey In Smart Investing\n\nColton Grant's career path has followed the broad arc of globalization and financial markets. After beginning in FX trading and currency management, she pivoted into asset allocation and multi-asset portfolios, before joining Barclays Global Investors and then BlackRock. She views those early years as formative, not just in building technical knowledge but in realizing that at the heart of strong investment strategies is the necessity of clear, human communication. \"You can have an amazing investment process, but if you can't articulate it in a way people understand, no one is going to invest with you,\" she shares.\n\nThat skill, which in practice means translating complex systems into human stories, became a cornerstone of her leadership style and one that would see her move between locations and offices before landing in Mellon Capital. There, she helped develop one of the ten largest liquid alternatives mutual funds in the U.S., before joining BNY Mellon as Deputy CIO and stepping into the CIO seat in 2020 at the height of a global pandemic.\n\nSmart Investing: Trust, Representation, and Legacy\n\nColtan Grant shares that while on reflection the pandemic era feels like a fever dream, it marked a unique moment in the investment ecosystem, when the personal, political, and economic suddenly converged. For a leader like Colton Grant, who had built her career on human connection and trust, her appointment as CIO couldn't have come at a more defining moment. \"Managing wealth, is above all, a human business with trust at the center,\" she shares, \"Our clients aren't just investing for themselves. They're thinking about the financial legacy of their families, often over generations.\" Increasingly, she notes, those conversations are being driven by a new generation, and a new type of investment profile - women.\n\nIt's a shift Colton Grant sees first hand, with a front-row seat to a growing wealth transfer, marked by a significant increase in female participation in angel investing, venture capital, and broader financial decision-making. She shares that this represents more than just a demographic shift. \"I meet with more women thinking about the financial legacy of their families, often over generations. It's a mindset shift, and one that's starting to show up in how capital moves and who's deciding where it goes. We are now at a time when most of the wealth from the Silent Generation and Baby Boomers is moving into the hands of women,\" she continues. \"That means more women will be making, or solely responsible for major financial decisions, many for the first time.\"\n\nSmart Investing: Women, Wealth, and the Power of Asking Questions\n\nFor Colton Grant, this means that representation isn't merely a moral imperative, it's a strategic advantage. \"Our clients want to see themselves reflected in the people managing their money. Diverse leadership teams make better decisions. It's that simple.\" That also means that helping more women step into investing has become both a personal mission and an economic imperative.\n\n\"Money means freedom,\" she says. \"Our financial markets have built tremendous wealth over time, and it's important that more women participate in that wealth creation by investing. I understand why it makes people nervous, but it doesn't have to be complicated. You can start small, with methods like a low-cost S&P index exposure which can generate strong returns over time.\"\n\nWhat she wants women to realize is that the ripple effects of investing extend far beyond individual portfolios. Women's increased participation creates a flywheel that benefits the broader macroeconomy. \"The data shows that more female investors also lead to more female founders receiving seed capital for their businesses. This is vital given that only 2% of overall venture capital dollars go to female-founded start-ups.\"\n\nAsked about her advice to women with the resources to invest but not sure how or where to start? Her reply echoes the age old investment mantra: there will never be a perfect moment. \"Time in the market beats timing the market. So just get started,\" she says.\n\nThe Investment Landscape Ahead\n\nAs for this moment we are in right now, marked by an unprecedented level of workplace and market uncertainty, Colton remains bullish on U.S. markets, citing strong underlying fundamentals, backed by innovation capacity, productivity growth, and healthy earning margins. Her investment philosophy doesn't listen to political noise. \"You don't invest with your politics,\" she says, \"You focus on the fundamentals.\"\n\nThe AI Tailwind, and What Comes Next In Smart Investing\n\nWhen asked where she thinks the opportunity lies, she shares that there are some clear emerging trends reshaping the industry. Private markets, which have long been the exclusive domain of institutional investors, are now more accessible through evergreen investment vehicles. Digital assets are gaining traction, particularly among younger generations, and, of course, artificial intelligence is a key factor. \"2025 will be a 'show me' year,\" she predicts. \"It's not just about tech companies, it's about how AI-driven productivity starts to ripple through sectors like healthcare, energy, and beyond.\"\n\nWhen asked what advice she'd offer women entering finance, Colton Grant boils it downto three things: Speak up, advocate for yourself- don't assume people will notice your work. Go before you're ready- don't wait to tick every box. Know the difference between mentors and sponsors - mentors offer guidance, but sponsors open doors.\n\nAbove all, however, Colton Grant shares that her trajectory - from a curious college student intrigued by currency shifts, to a leader at the forefront of finance's biggest transformation - boils down to one undeniable truth: success and smart investing hinges on trust. As she puts it, \"people buy people. Trust is everything.\" For Sinead Colton Grant, aligning trust is more than virtue, it's a movement led increasingly by women like her who are reshaping finance from every role: client, leader, founder, and investor.",

      "description": "Once limitations are overcome, digital twins could solve the urgent challenge of shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.\n\nOnce limitations are overcome, digital twins could solve the urgent challenge of shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.\n\nSHARJAH, EMIRATE OF SHARJAH, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, July 28, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- As the world grapples with the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change, researchers at the University of Sharjah are turning to a cutting-edge technology that could reshape the future of energy: AI-powered digital twins.\n\nAccording to the researchers, these digital replicas of the physical world have the potential to transform the generation, management, and optimization of energy across diverse clean energy platforms, accelerating the transition away from fossil fuels, which environmental scientists associate with global warming.\n\nDigital twins' ability to replicate and interact with complex systems has made them a cornerstone of innovation across industries, driving improvements in efficiency, cost reduction, and the development of novel solutions.\n\nHowever, the scientists caution that current digital twin models still face notable limitations that restrict their full potential in harnessing energy from sources such as wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric, and biomass.\n\n\"Digital twins are highly effective in optimizing renewable energy systems,\" the researchers write in the journal Energy Nexus. \"Yet, each energy source presents unique challenges—ranging from data variability and environmental conditions to system complexity—that can limit the performance of digital twin technologies, despite their considerable promise in improving energy generation and management.\" ()\n\nIn their study, the authors conducted an extensive review of existing literature on the application of digital twins in renewable energy systems. They examined various contexts, functions, lifecycles, and architectural frameworks to understand how digital twins are currently being utilized and where gaps remain.\n\nTo extract meaningful insights, the researchers employed advanced text mining techniques, leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing. This scientifically rigorous approach enabled them to analyze large volumes of raw data and uncover structured patterns, concepts, and emerging trends.\n\nFrom this in-depth analysis, the authors drew several key conclusions. They identified research gaps, proposed new directions, and outlined the challenges that must be addressed to fully harness the potential of digital twin technology in the renewable energy sector.\n\nFollowing a detailed discussion on the integration of digital twins across various renewable energy applications, the authors summarized their most significant findings across five major energy sources: wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric, and biomass. Each source presents unique opportunities and challenges, and the study offers a comprehensive overview of how digital twins can be tailored to optimize performance in each domain.\n\nThe study reveals that digital twins offer significant advantages across various renewable energy systems:\n\nWind Energy: Digital twins can predict unknown parameters and correct inaccurate measurements, enhancing system reliability and performance.\n\nSolar Energy: They help identify key factors that influence efficiency and output power, enabling better system design and optimization.\n\nGeothermal Energy: Digital twins can simulate the entire operational process—particularly drilling—facilitating cost analysis and reducing both time and expenses.\n\nHydroelectric Energy: The AI-driven models simulate system dynamics to identify influencing factors. In older hydro plants, they are used to mitigate the impact of worker fatigue on productivity.\n\nBiomass Energy: Digital twins improve performance and management by offering deep insights into operational processes and plant configurations.\n\nBut the authors' contribution to the field stands out in highlighting critical limitations in the application of digital twin technology across these energy sources. Their analysis underscores the need for more robust models that can address specific challenges unique to each renewable energy system.\n\nThe authors identify several limitations in the application of digital twins across different renewable energy systems:\n\nWind Energy: Digital twins face challenges in accurately modeling and monitoring environmental conditions. They struggle to simulate critical factors such as blade erosion, gearbox degradation, and electrical system performance—particularly in aging turbines.\n\nSolar Energy: Despite their potential, digital twins still fall short in reliably predicting long-term performance. They have difficulty tracking panel degradation and accounting for environmental influences over time, which affects their accuracy and usefulness.\n\nGeothermal Energy: A major obstacle is the lack of high-quality data, which hampers the ability of digital twins to simulate geological uncertainties and subsurface conditions. The technology also faces complexity in modeling the long-term behavior of geothermal systems, including heat transfer and fluid flow dynamics.\n\nHydroelectric energy: Applied to hydroelectric projects, digital twins face challenges in accurately modeling water flow variability and in capturing environmental and ecological constraints. These limitations reduce their effectiveness in optimizing system performance and sustainability.\n\nbiomass energy: When used with biomass energy systems, digital twins still struggle to simulate the entire production supply chain. They fall short in providing precise models for biological processes, biomass conversion, and the complex biochemical and thermochemical reactions involved.\n\nThe authors emphasize the broader implications of these shortcomings for the renewable energy sector. To address these challenges, they offer a set of guidelines and a research roadmap aimed at helping scientists enhance the reliability and precision of digital twin technologies.\n\nTheir recommendations focus on improving data collection methods, advancing modeling techniques, and expanding computational capabilities to ensure digital twins can deliver trustworthy insights for decision-making and system optimization.",

      "description": "StarRupture is an open-world, survival crafting game set in space from indie studio Creepy Jar. This is the studio's second survival game, having produced Green Hell. Taking more of an automation route with their space title, you'll explore a strange world within the Ruptura system. Your mission: gather resources and ship products to various companies. The only catch is you're a prisoner and you're on this planet to pay off your debt. \n\nStarRupture Preview | Space Based Survival\n\nFor the playtest, you only have one prisoner option: the Scientist. The details of your crime are marked confidential. How much you owe isn't listed anywhere, so you don't actually know what you need to earn to be free. You don't even learn much about the program you're in, which makes a free future possible.\n\nWhat you do know is that dying increases your debt. This is due to each death triggering a new sleeve, a fresh body, to be fabricated. While the body is also referred to as a shell in some conversations, sleeve is the primary way to refer to it. This reminds me directly of Altered Carbon, which could be an inspiration for StarRupture. \n\nCompleting shipments is how you unlock new crafting benches, upgrades, and weapons. To finish any of the available shipment lines for a company, you'll have to construct multiple crafting buildings, including smelters, fabricators, furnaces, and more. The assembly lines, known as rails, may cross much of the area by the end of your experience. This makes it similar to games like Satisfactory that combine survival with crafting automation. \n\nWhen it comes to the region you can explore, there are multiple environments you can interact with, giving you a taste of the different biomes you may experience throughout the full title. There are ponds, a radiation zone, a meadow area that drains your movement and health, as well as the rocky crags where you'll often find large ore veins. There are strange rock pillars you'll discover, holes that are currently covered by vines but have something glowing within, and two different ruins you can pillage. \n\nThis is where the mystery comes in. In the remaining buildings, you'll find notes about body enhancements gone awry, other prisoners that've worked on the planet, and a potential murder. None of the questions brought up are answered. It's assumed these will be explored when you have free rein in Early Access.  \n\nPlaytest Woes | StarRupture Preview\n\nOverall, the playtest had few bugs, the largest one focusing on the enemies, the Vermin. At times and typically affecting only the easiest variety of the creature, you'll see them flickering, as if a broken light was illuminating their bodies. This makes it hard on the eyes and harder to aim shots at them. The only other issue I ran into was that, upon respawn, I would get momentarily stuck in the regeneration pod and have to jump out of it instead of just walking. \n\nThere are more than just the basic vermin. You can encounter up to four additional types. The blue exploding ones emit infection, green ones spit venom, others have viscous claws, and the final type combines venom with burning for a rapid death. The basic variety is the sole one affected by the flickering. \n\nThese are the only enemies you'll run into while playing. They often attack in swarms and can be difficult to deal with initially. Once you get a pistol and grenades, they are easily negated. With little in the way of a challenge, the playtest can feel less like a survival title and primarily a crafting automation. \n\nAlong with the flickering bug and lack of challenge, the dialogue may use AI-generated voices at some points. This is the most obvious when listening to an audio recording concerning a female prisoner. The voice of Harvey Summers is flat, with no emotion and an odd cadence, all pointing to AI. On the Steam page for the game, there is no note of AI usage in the title, nor is there anything listed on the website. Whether this is a simple placeholder oversight or lackluster voice acting is unknown. \n\nAnother issue with the audio is when a Rupture is about to hit. There are dueling lines playing at the same time. It's disrupting to the gameplay and can make it hard to actually understand what's happening during the first instance. It doesn't impact the overall playtest, however, as you can read what's being said to know how to react. \n\nWhile StarRupture has a mystery, all it presents in the playtest are small tidbits to reel you in. What's known of the story is well written. The gameplay is straightforward survival mechanics utilizing automation to achieve objectives. There's just not enough to differentiate it from other titles on the market at this time. I am intrigued to see how the story and world expand when it finally releases into Early Access. \n\nStarRupture was previewed on PC over the span of 9.5 hours with a code provided by Creepy Jar. All screenshots were taken during the course of the preview.",

      "description": "China's Robotaxi revolution is shifting into a higher gear. In May, we highlighted a Goldman Sachs note forecasting that 500,000 autonomous robotaxis would be operating across ten major cities by 2030. New data from the bank's analysts now show acceleration: a wave of new commercial operating licenses has been granted to Robotaxi operators.\n\nA team of Goldman analysts led by Allen Chang and Verena Jeng wrote in a note to clients on Monday that companies including Pony AI, Baidu, WeRide, JinJiang Taxi, DaZhong Transportation, and SAIC Motor were granted Robotaxi licenses to operate intelligent connected vehicles in Shanghai. The licenses were announced during the World Artificial Intelligence Conference over the weekend. \n\n\"In Shanghai, Robotaxi operators that have received licenses can operate fully driverless Robotaxi for public passengers and charge fares in the designated areas of Shanghai,\" said the analysts. \n\nhttps://t.co/jCrY756ajt just got the permit to launch commercial Robotaxi ops in Shanghai's Pudong.\nWe will start from Jinqiao & Huamu (steps from Lujiazui ).\nWho's ready to catch us on the streets? ♂️ pic.twitter.com/H5Yz5Hpgsf\n\n— Pony.ai (@PonyAI_tech) July 26, 2025\n\nThis development led the analysts to maintain a bullish call on the industry: \"We are positive on the expanding areas of Robotaxi commercial services to support the Robotaxi industry growth, along with enhanced technology, lower BOM cost for larger scale deployment, and ecosystem expansion across Robotaxi operators, car OEMs, asset owners.\" \n\nThe key insight: Shanghai is emerging as a major hub for Robotaxi commercialization, while Chinese operators are aggressively expanding into global markets.\n\nHighlights from the note:\n\nDriverless Robotaxi services in Shanghai: Multiple Chinese Robotaxi operators have received new licenses during WAIC. Pony AI announced it received a permit for fully driverless commercial Robotaxi services in Shanghai Pudong New Area, and will start from Jinqiao and Huamu district first, then expand to other regions. Baidu received the driverless commercial Robotaxi services permit in Shanghai, and Baidu Apollo Go cooperates with DaZhong Transportation in Shanghai on Robotaxi operation. WeRide announced the company received a permit for driverless Robotaxi services through partnership with Chery and JinJiang Taxi in Shanghai Pudong. WeRide also showcased its new generation of Robotaxi model Chery CER, supported by WeRide One platform. SAIC IM Motor, SAIC Mobility and Johnson Taxi jointly announced the new demonstration and operation license, targeting to offer Robotaxi services between Shanghai International Tourism and Resorts Zone and Shanghai Pudong Intl. Airport.\n\nRead-across to China Robotaxi market: We recently raised China Robotaxi TAM and expect China's Robotaxi market to reach US$14bn/ US$61bn in 2030E/ 2035E with fleet size at 535k/ 2.3m units in 2030E/ 2035E, supported by enhancing software/ hardware capability to improve Robotaxi's safety and ride experience. The accelerated commercialization of the Robotaxi market in Shanghai starting from PuDong New Area, echoes our view that Tier-1 cities wiill see faster ramp up in the initial stage, considering customer acceptance, regulatory support and better operational efficiency.\n\nOverseas market in expansion: Chinese Robotaxi vendors are also accelerating their expansion to the overseas markets, which is supporting rising Robotaxi commercialization. In July, WeRide announced it launched its Robotaxi pilot service in Saudi Arabia Riyadh post the announcement of expansion into Saudi Arabia in May 2025 with support from the Transport General Authority. Pony AI announced Robotaxi road-testing in Luxembourg in July, post receiving the scientific testing permit from Luxembourg's Ministry of Mobility and Public Works for L4 autonomous driving in Apr this year. The initial Robotaxi testing began in the community of Lenningen of Luxembourg, then expanded to more areas.\n\nOf the Robotaxi firms listed by the analysts, Pony AI stands out as the most interesting.\n\n*PONY AI GETS PERMIT TO PROVIDE DRIVERLESS ROBOTAXIS IN SHANGHAI https://t.co/Y8fvTD3hgG\n\n— zerohedge (@zerohedge) July 28, 2025\n\nIt designs, develops, and operates Level 4 fully autonomous Robotaxis. Yet shares of the Chinese company, which trades in the U.S., have remained mostly flat this year, despite all the AI and Robotaxi hype in recent months.\n\nRelated: \n\nLearn about North America's robotaxi market:\n\n. . .\n\nLoading recommendations...",

After her significant other introduced popular titles like Roblox and Minecraft into their home, the 9-year-old became \"addicted.\" Banks turned to her AI assistant for advice. It suggested creating a contract to set boundaries around York's video game usage, including limiting the days and hours he can play, as well as tying it to completing chores and homework. Though Banks said her son signed the contract, she admitted it has been challenging to consistently enforce the rules, given her busy work schedule.

      "link": "http://ct.moreover.com/?a=57326053643&p=189&v=1&x=BCIqteNoWCGeNF4ZlwU0bQ",
      "description": "Public relations professionals are storytellers by trade. We shape perception, manage reputation, and translate strategy into narrative. But as brands become more dependent on digital platforms, AI integrations, and real-time communication, the language of PR is beginning to overlap with the logic of engineering.\n\nThat's not a bad thing. In fact, it's a missed opportunity if we don't embrace it.\n\nThe tools, metaphors, and models that engineers use to build resilient, scalable systems can teach us how to construct smarter, more adaptable brand stories. More importantly, these metaphors give PR teams a new way to talk to executive stakeholders, internal teams, and media alike with clarity, technical credibility, and strategic depth.\n\nThis blog explores what PR can learn from system design. It's not just for acing system design interviews or sounding smarter, but to be more effective, especially in high-pressure moments when clarity, coordination, and responsiveness matter most.\n\nThe Problem: We're Still Explaining Brands in Pre-Internet Language\n\nWhile communications technology has evolved, with Slack threads, crisis dashboards, and social listening tools, our language often hasn't. PR still leans heavily on metaphors like \"narratives,\" \"loud voices,\" and \"megaphones.\"\n\nBut those analog metaphors struggle to explain:\n\nHow a global brand stays consistent across time zones.\nWhy internal latency creates external perception gaps.\nHow multi-channel brand orchestration mirrors load-balanced systems.\n\nThis communication gap grows wider when talking with tech-savvy executives or cross-functional teams. If you're pitching a campaign or a strategic response to a CTO, CISO, or product leader, old-school PR language doesn't resonate.\n\nSystem design metaphors do.\n\nFrom Engineering to Messaging: 5 System Design Metaphors Every PR Pro Should Know\n\nLet's explore five system design concepts that can serve as high-clarity metaphors for modern brand strategy, storytelling, and reputation management:\n\n1. Load Balancing = Smart Multitasking Across Brand Channels\n\nIn engineering, load balancers distribute incoming requests across multiple servers so no single resource gets overwhelmed. They ensure responsiveness and reliability.\n\nIn PR, the same concept applies to:\n\nMulti-channel campaign management.\nReactive and proactive messaging balance.\nInternal vs. external stakeholder engagement.\n\nBrand metaphor: A smart brand \"load balances\" its communications across media, social, owned, and partner channels. If one outlet is overloaded or offline (e.g., a social media outage or media embargo), another picks up the slack.\n\nStrategic application:\n\nAllocate spokesperson bandwidth across time zones.\nTime media releases based on traffic peaks.\nShift paid and earned focus based on attention availability.\n\nIf your campaign fails because all attention was pushed to one press release, you're suffering from a load imbalance.\n\n2. System Failure = Crisis Response\n\nIn system architecture, failure is inevitable, so teams design for resilience. That means:\n\nAutomatic failovers.\nRedundant systems.\nGraceful degradation.\n\nIn PR, failure looks like a brand crisis. A product defect, executive controversy, or a social backlash. The difference between brands that survive and those that implode isn't the presence of failure, but how they respond.\n\nBrand metaphor: A brand with crisis readiness is like a well-architected system. It doesn't panic when things go wrong. It reroutes messaging, spins up backup spokespeople, and isolates reputational damage.\n\nBest practices:\n\nBuild escalation paths into your PR response playbooks.\nMaintain backup statements and position documents.\nConduct simulation drills with real-time coordination tools.\n\nYou don't need to prevent every crisis. You need to design your story infrastructure to survive it.\n\n3. Latency = Brand Responsiveness\n\nIn engineering, latency is the delay between a user's request and the system's response. High latency creates a bad user experience, including sluggish apps, laggy interfaces, and poor engagement.\n\nIn PR, latency looks like:\n\nDelayed media responses.\nSlow clarification during a controversy.\nCampaigns that miss the moment.\n\nBrand metaphor: A brand with low latency responds quickly, clearly, and contextually. It has tight feedback loops between internal decision-making and external messaging.\n\nStrategic shifts:\n\nShorten sign-off chains on reactive statements.\nMonitor sentiment in real time to adjust positioning.\nEmpower regional teams with aligned, but autonomous, messaging authority.\n\nBrand latency is measurable. And in a TikTok-driven news cycle, every second matters.\n\n4. Observability = Narrative Clarity\n\nObservability in engineering refers to a system's ability to explain its internal state based on external outputs. Engineers want to know why something broke.\n\nIn brand communications, the same logic applies:\n\nAre media metrics connected to sentiment trends?\nDo internal comms reflect external headlines?\nCan we trace message performance to business outcomes?\n\nBrand metaphor: An observable brand is understandable. Stakeholders, press, and employees all know what it stands for, why it matters, and how its narrative connects to reality.\n\nTactical application:\n\nUse integrated PR dashboards with performance metadata.\nInclude attribution paths from coverage to outcomes.\nMaintain campaign post-mortems and communication debriefs.\n\nTransparency is how brands build trust internally and externally.\n\n5. Event-Driven Architecture = Responsive Messaging\n\nEvent-driven systems in software trigger actions based on real-time inputs (e.g., \"if this happens, do that\"). This reduces waste and increases contextual relevance.\n\nIn PR, many teams still operate on batch logic: quarterly reports, monthly plans, pre-scheduled campaigns.\n\nBrand metaphor: A brand using an event-driven model adapts to what's happening right now. It releases messages in response to live developments, not static calendars.\n\nPR execution:\n\nLaunch owned content based on earned media spikes.\nIssue quick takes during fast-developing news cycles.\nAdjust message cadence based on live sentiment data.\n\nStop \"polling\" the media environment. Start responding to events in real time.\n\nHow These Metaphors Help PR Teams Work Cross-Functionally\n\nBridging the Language Gap with Product and Engineering\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in PR is gaining respect and shared vocabulary across technical functions. Product leaders think in systems. So do CTOs. And engineers value clarity, consistency, and modular thinking.\n\nWhen PR pros borrow the language of system design:\n\nMessage plans feel more rigorous.\nCrisis strategies become more credible.\nBrand health reports feel more like observability dashboards than vanity metrics.\n\nYou don't have to be a developer to speak their language. You just need the metaphors.\n\nPositioning the Brand Internally Like a Platform\n\nThink about your brand like a platform:\n\nSpokespeople are your APIs.\nCampaigns are user-facing interfaces.\nPositioning docs are the architecture specs.\n\nWhen everything aligns, your brand performs like a high-availability system: fast, fault-tolerant, and scalable.\n\nTips for Applying System Design Thinking to Brand Comms\n\nHere are six ways PR teams can practically adopt these principles:\n\n1. Build Brand Resilience Playbooks\n\nTreat crisis response like failure mode handling.\nInclude load balancing logic and communication failovers. \n\n2. Measure Latency in Your Workflows\n\nTrack time between issue surfacing and response publishing.\nIdentify chokepoints in approvals and stakeholder reviews. \n\n3. Use Dashboards Like Observability Tools\n\nIntegrate earned, paid, owned, and shared media analytics.\nConnect PR data with customer behavior, conversions, or product activity. \n\n4. Adopt Modular Messaging Frameworks\n\nTreat brand statements like reusable components.\nDesign templates for different use cases: funding, product news, and response. \n\n5. Create Event-Driven Publishing Triggers\n\nTie internal alerts to campaign or comms actions.\nUse media intelligence to automate social posts or reporter briefings. \n\n6. Balance Campaign Load Across Channels\n\nDon't over-rely on one channel for brand exposure.\nUse staggered publishing to ensure attention distribution.\n\nThese shifts aren't theoretical. They're immediately actionable and future-proof.\n\nThe New PR Operating System: Engineered for Trust\n\nStorytelling will always be the core of public relations. But in a digital-first world, the story alone isn't enough. The differentiator is how you architect the delivery, monitor the outcome, and adapt the response.\n\nEngineering teaches us to expect failure, distribute load, and measure latency. These are not just software values. They are survival values for brands in 2025.\n\nThe next time you're asked to explain how your team handles reputation management, campaign orchestration, or crisis planning, try swapping in the metaphors from above.\n\nYou'll be amazed at how clearly the system speaks.",

      "description": "SEOUL (July 28): Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk said the US automaker had signed a US$16.5 billion (RM69.79 billion) deal to source chips from Samsung Electronics, a move expected to bolster the South Korean tech giant's loss-making contract manufacturing business.\n\nSamsung's shares jumped as much as 6.8% to their highest since September last year after news of the deal. Tesla shares were up 1.9% in US premarket trading.\n\nMusk said Samsung's new chip factory in Taylor, Texas will make Tesla's next-generation AI6 chip, potentially re-energising the project that has faced long delays amid Samsung's difficulties in retaining and attracting major clients.\n\n\"Samsung agreed to allow Tesla to assist in maximising manufacturing efficiency. This is a critical point, as I will walk the line personally to accelerate the pace of progress. And the fab is conveniently located not far from my house,\" Musk said in a post on X on Monday.\n\n\"The US$16.5B number is just the bare minimum. Actual output is likely to be several times higher,\" he said in another post.\n\nAccording to a senior analyst at NH Investment & Securities, Ryu Young-ho, Samsung's Taylor fab \"so far had virtually no customers, so this order is quite meaningful\".\n\nIn October, Reuters reported that Samsung had postponed taking deliveries of ASML chipmaking equipment for its Texas factory, as it had not yet won any major customers for the project. It has already delayed the plant's operational start to 2026.\n\nPotential production timeline\n\nWhile no timeline was provided for AI6 chip production, Musk has previously said that next-generation AI5 chips will be produced at the end of 2026, suggesting AI6 would follow.\n\nLee Dong-ju, an analyst at SK Securities, expects production in 2027 or 2028, but Tesla has a history of missing its targets.\n\nSamsung currently makes Tesla's AI4 chips, which power its full self-driving driver assistant system, while TSMC is slated to make the AI5, initially in Taiwan and then Arizona, Musk has said.\n\nSamsung, the world's top memory-chip maker, also produces logic chips designed by customers through its foundry business. The Texas project is central to Samsung chairman Jay Y Lee's strategy to expand beyond its bread-and-butter memory chips into contract chip manufacturing.\n\nIt holds just 8% of the global foundry market, far behind industry leader TSMC, which has a 67% share, data from market researcher Trendforce show.\n\nSamsung had earlier announced the US$16.5 billion chip-supply deal without naming the client, saying the customer had requested confidentiality about the details of the deal, which will run through the end of 2033.\n\nThree sources briefed about the matter told Reuters that Tesla was the customer for the deal.\n\nHelp Samsung's foundry business\n\nThe deal with Tesla comes as Samsung, which is due to report its earnings on Thursday, faces mounting pressure in the race to produce artificial intelligence (AI) chips, where it trails rivals such as TSMC and SK Hynix. This lag has weighed heavily on its profit and share price.\n\nEarlier this month, Samsung projected a 56% drop in second-quarter operating profit, partly due to widening losses of its foundry business.\n\nPak Yuak, an analyst at Kiwoom Securities, said the deal would help reduce losses at Samsung's foundry business, which he estimates exceeded five trillion won (US$3.6 billion) in the first half of the year.\n\nAnalysts say Samsung has struggled to retain key clients, with many defecting to TSMC for advanced chips, underscoring technological challenges the firm faces in the race to stay relevant in the capital intensive business.\n\nTSMC counts Apple, Nvidia and Qualcomm among its customers.\n\nIt is not clear whether the Samsung-Tesla deal is related to ongoing trade talks between South Korea and the United States. Seoul is seeking US partnerships in chips and shipbuilding, amid last-ditch efforts to reach a trade deal to eliminate or reduce potential 25% US tariffs.\n\nUploaded by Liza Shireen Koshy\n\nSource: TheEdge - 29 Jul 2025",

      "description": "Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng (right) and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are leading the delegations over two days of talks in Stockholm starting from Monday — their third meeting in less than three months.\n\nSTOCKHOLM (July 28): US and Chinese officials kicked off two days of talks aimed at extending their tariff truce beyond a mid-August deadline and hashing out ways to maintain trade ties while safeguarding economic security.\n\nChinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are leading the delegations through Tuesday in Stockholm — their third meeting in less than three months. The agenda includes discussions about how long the current tariff truce can be extended, as well as US levies tied to fentanyl trafficking, and Chinese purchases of sanctioned Russian and Iranian oil.\n\nThe meeting began a day after the US President Donald Trump announced an agreement with the European Union (EU) ahead of an Aug 1 deadline to conclude deals with dozens of countries. Talks with Beijing are on a different track with rates for China well above those for other major economies.\n\n\"We come into these meetings frankly with a strong hand, having made deals with the EU, Japan and many others,\" US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said in an interview on Monday with MSNBC, before arriving with Bessent at the venue. \"The fact that we are regularly meeting with them to address these issues, I think that gives us a good footing for these negotiations.\"\n\nSpeaking in Scotland on Sunday to announce the EU deal, Trump gave a brief update on Washington's relations with Beijing. \"We're very close to a deal with China. We really sort of made a deal with China, but we'll see how that goes,\" he said without elaborating.\n\nBessent said in recent days that the US would use this week's huddle to work out what's \"likely an extension\" to the current tariff pause, adding: \"I think trade is in a very good place with China.\"\n\nAny breakthrough could help set the stage for Trump to meet with his counterpart Xi Jinping, possibly around a major summit later this year in South Korea. The Chinese leader invited Trump — along with first lady Melania Trump — to visit China in a phone call last month, but no timeframe has yet been set.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick wasn't in Stockholm for the start of the talks on Monday, two people familiar with the matter said, after he indicated on Bloomberg TV last week he was planning to be there.\n\nExport controls\n\nLutnick attended the London round in June where export controls were added to the trade talks for the first time — breaking with precedent that national security actions are non-negotiable.\n\nThe Commerce chief has been in favour of loosening US restrictions on Nvidia's H20 chip, a move that Trump approved earlier this month, and is advocating for a purchase deal with Beijing that would stop short of addressing systemic factors in the relationship, people familiar with internal deliberations said.\n\nOffering subtle insight into how the logistics of talks between the two nations could be arranged, Swedish Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson wrote in a social media post last week that representatives from both the US and China approached her during a Group of 20 gathering in South Africa earlier this month to propose holding their tariff negotiations in Sweden.\n\nAt the heart of the haggling between the world's largest economies is Beijing's stranglehold on rare-earth magnets used to make everything from electric vehicles to high-tech weapons, and Washington's curbs on cutting-edge chips essential to artificial intelligence (AI). The battle over export controls has become a critical component of trade talks.\n\nReducing the 20% fentanyl tariffs Trump imposed over US claims Chinese companies supply chemicals used to make the illegal drug is also a high priority for Beijing, Eurasia Group analysts wrote in a note last week, citing recent meetings with Ministry of Public Security officials. Ministry officials traveled to the Geneva talks in May and will likely go to Stockholm, the analysts wrote.\n\nWhile China has denied it is responsible for the flow of the deadly drug, last month it tightened controls over two chemicals that can be used to make the opioid. Earlier this month, Trump praised those moves. \"China has been helping out,\" he told reporters. \"We're talking to them and they're making big steps.\"\n\nFor the US, the recent Chinese actions aren't enough, as such moves were required to comply with United Nations measures, according to a person familiar with the trade talks. Chances of reducing the 20% tariff in this round of talks are very slim, added the person who asked not to be identified discussing sensitive matters, while noting everything could change on Trump's whim.\n\nChina would be willing to cooperate more on fentanyl, said Sun Chenghao, a professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing, but the US would have to remove the related tariffs, stop blaming Beijing for what it sees as a US domestic problem and provide concrete evidence of crimes.\n\nThe US business community remains hopeful for progress, with Sean Stein, president of the US-China Business Council, telling Bloomberg TV that movement on fentanyl presents the \"biggest opportunity\" in talks.\n\n\"That then lowers tariffs on the US side, which then opens the door for China to lower tariffs that lets us sell agriculture, lets us sell airplanes, lets us sell automobiles, that lets us sell energy,\" he said.\n\nOil purchases\n\nIn his comments announcing the talks, Bessent indicated negotiations can now take on a broader array of topics, potentially including Beijing's continued purchases of sanctioned oil from Russia and Iran.\n\nChinese state media has already pushed back against that idea. \"China won't play along\" with such attempts to use Beijing to kill Russia's economy, Lv Xiang, a US expert with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the state-run tabloid Global Times last week.\n\nBy contrast, China's imports of three major energy products from the US hit almost zero in June, marking the first time in almost three years the Asian nation didn't import any crude oil from its top rival. Deliveries of American crude oil, liquefied natural gas and coal have been subject to Chinese tariffs of 10% to 15% since February.\n\nXi's government has begun rolling back some of its other retaliatory measures since the two sides met last month in London. Crucially, Beijing has boosted shipments of rare earth magnets, while the US relaxed restrictions on sales of less-advanced semiconductors to China.\n\nIn another potential goodwill gesture, as the Sweden talks were announced this month, China revealed it had suspended an antitrust investigation into the local unit of US chemical manufacturer DuPont de Nemours Inc.\n\nChina's colossal manufacturing output will also be a talking point for Trump's team.\n\nBessent said the US hopes to see China \"pull back on some of this glut of manufacturing that they're doing and concentrate on building a consumer economy\".\n\nUploaded by Felyx Teoh\n\nSource: TheEdge - 29 Jul 2025",

      "description": "SUBANG JAYA (July 28): A total of 10,000 local engineers are expected to be trained in the semiconductor field through a training programme by Arm, a UK semiconductor design firm, over 10 years, said Selangor Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari.\n\nThe programme, known as Arm On-Demand, is the first Arm-led training programme in the country, and is a strategic collaboration with the Advanced Semiconductor Academy of Malaysia (ASEM), a statement from ASEM said.\n\nIt is aligned with the country's efforts to accelerate its ambition to develop home-grown chips within five to 10 years due to growing global demand for artificial intelligence and data centre technologies, the statement said.\n\nAmirudin said the initiative targets around 1,000 participants annually, with the first batch of 400 engineers already enrolled.\n\n\"So, if we run two or three cohorts, we can reach that target each year,\" he told reporters at the programme's launch on Monday.\n\nThe event's highlight was a partnership signing ceremony between Arm, ASEM and 20 Malaysian universities, a symbolic and unified commitment to advancing semiconductor education and research.\n\nThe programme brings together participants from over 40 universities and engineers representing more than 80 companies across the semiconductor and technology sectors, reflecting strong national interest and commitment to talent development in advanced chip design.\n\nAmirudin said the training, which focuses on front-end integrated circuit (IC) design, began earlier this year with the IC Design Part 1 course in Puchong, and positions Malaysia as a leading and sustainable front-end player in the semiconductor industry.\n\nAs of now, Amirudin said the Selangor government has committed between RM5 million and RM10 million annually to propel the front end of the semiconductor value chain.\n\nHe also said the federal government, through the Economy Ministry, has increased its support to RM100 million from RM60 million. This underscores national-level confidence in the initiative, with total investments expected to exceed RM100 million over the next decade.\n\nAmirudin also said he believes the Arm On-Demand programme will move Selangor and Malaysia from completely relying on foreign direct investment towards building leaders and start-ups that will one day transform into leading companies that invest and export overseas.\n\n\"We must envision a technological ecosystem where we do not solely export, but a space and place where Malaysian companies can similarly move up the economic value chain to utilise and be consumers of these chips.\n\n\"We must move towards owning the intellectual property, so that these chips are not just labelled 'assembled in Selangor', but 'designed in Selangor', 'made in Malaysia',\" Amirudin said.\n\nAmirudin said these ambitions will be detailed in Selangor Plan 2, which is set to be launched next year. He expressed confidence that semiconductor and electrical and electronics engineering will be prioritised under the upcoming 13th Malaysia Plan, to be announced by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim on July 31.\n\nDeputy Investment, Trade and Industry Minister Liew Chin Tong and Selangor State Executive Councillor for Investment, Trade and Mobility Ng Sze Han witnessed the ceremony on Monday.\n\nUploaded by Tham Yek Lee\n\nSource: TheEdge - 29 Jul 2025",

      "description": "Chemicals Market Retreats Amid Economic Headwinds, Divestments and Hotspots Keep M&A Afloat\n\nWhile the U.S. Chemicals market has remained fertile ground for merger and acquisition (M&A) activity—driven by low energy costs and domestic market integration—transaction activity has come under increased pressure, mirroring recent broader industry trends. Commodity players have been squeezed by margin compression, overcapacity, and global competition. Recent U.S. tariffs on imported chemicals, particularly from China, have increased production costs for domestic manufacturers. However, while tariffs pose challenges, they also offer an opportunity for U.S. chemical producers to gain a competitive edge over Chinese counterparts by capitalizing on domestic resources and reducing reliance on imports. Public strategics have looked towards inorganic and organic growth strategies to increase North American production and distribution capabilities to meet increased demand and combat tariff threats. Beyond geographic footprint, sector acquirers have been willing to pay a premium for targets with key end market exposure and strong margin profiles that can shore up supply chains. Businesses serving the Life Sciences, Pharmaceutical, Electric Vehicles (EVs), and Aerospace & Defense segments have rapidly grown, and profitable specialty producers have commanded robust valuations. This demand has driven consolidation in the U.S. Chemicals market as buyers seek to gain access to the region's established infrastructure, skilled labor, and regulatory frameworks.\n\nImproving visibility on global trade, abundant domestic energy supply and supportive policy provide a constructive backdrop for entrepreneurs, capital flows, and ultimately M&A in the U.S. Chemical market.\n\nRen NebelManaging Director, Capstone Partners\n\nChemicals Market M&A Slumps as Economic Turbulence Prompts Portfolio Reviews\n\nOf the M&A transactions being brought to market, divestments and portfolio realignment strategies have been a relative \"bright spot\" for Chemicals M&A to date. High capital expenditures, cyclical demand fluctuations, and increased competition from regions with lower production costs have contributed to this downturn. M&A volume in the Chemicals sector has weakened through year to date (YTD), with 63 transactions announced or completed compared to 87 during the same period in 2024. Although YTD volume has declined 27.6% year-over-year (YOY), opportunities for M&A remain as larger players have sought to divest struggling or unprofitable segments and buyers look to capitalize on discounted valuations. Shell's (LSE:SHEL) recent decision to divest its chemical assets in the U.S. and Europe underscores the realignment trends defining the sector in YTD 2025. Shell's Chemicals division has faced profitability challenges, reporting a $432 million loss to adjusted earnings last year, according to its Q4 2024 and full year unaudited results report.1 In response, Shell has initiated a strategic review of its chemicals operations, considering the sale of facilities such as the Deer Park plant in Texas and other sites in Pennsylvania, Louisiana, the U.K., Germany, and the Netherlands. By reallocating resources away from underperforming chemical assets, Shell aims to enhance shareholder value and reinforce its position in more profitable operating units. This environment has presented opportunities for corporate buyers and other investors to acquire established assets, potentially leading to increased consolidation and innovation within the sector.\n\nStrategic buyers will likely remain well-positioned to bolster new and existing North American operations and product offerings in the near term via acquisitions of tariff-resilient targets. Strategic acquirers have continued to account for the majority (52.4%) of sector transactions YTD. This cohort has remained relatively stable, falling by one deal YOY to date. Notably, in March, OMV (WBAG:OMW) and Abu Dhabi Oil Co. (ADNOC) announced the merger of their petrochemical joint ventures Borealis and Borouge (ADX:BOROUGE) and its acquisition of NOVA Chemicals for $9.4 billion, equivalent to approximately 7.5x EV/EBITDA on the basis of expected through-the-cycle EBITDA. The deal is expected to form a $60 billion petrochemical business and the fourth-largest global polyolefins producer with a significant North American presence according to S&P Global's Chemical Week.2 Apart from a handful of large-scale deals of foreign buyers entering the North American market, strategics have increasingly targeted lower ($10-100 million) and core ($100-250 million) middle market businesses to bolster capabilities and add complementary products or services without the integration challenges of large-scale, transformational deals. This has impacted total disclosed deal value, which has declined 21.1% YOY. However, average deal values for transactions less than $1 billion have reached $238.5 million in YTD 2025, a slight increase of 4.5% YOY from $228.3 million in the prior year period. Private strategics have pulled away from the space, deterred by current economic volatility and tariff concerns. This cohort of private buyers has accounted for 48.7% fewer transactions YOY through YTD 2025, the main culprit for weakening sector M&A.\n\nSector M&A valuations have risen YOY, with the average purchase multiple approaching 9.0x EV/EBITDA through YTD 2025 compared to 8.4x EV/EBITDA in the prior year period. However, the average EV/EBITDA multiple in YTD 2025 jumps to 9.6x when excluding deal multiples from divestitures, which draw discounted valuations due to underperformance. Multiples in the Chemicals middle market from 2021 through YTD averaged 10.0x EV/EBITDA and have continuously outperformed the broader Industrials middle market (9.0x EV/EBITDA). Healthy sector multiples have been indicative of a flight to quality assets, where companies with resilient margin profiles have commanded high valuations.\n\nAI Applications in Resilient Life Sciences End Markets Provide Consolidation Opportunities\n\nChemicals market participants serving Life Sciences end markets—specifically Pharmaceuticals, Biotech, and Diagnostics—have garnered significant acquisition interest and premium valuations due to their stable demand, high-margin profiles, and exposure to long-term growth trends. Investors have been drawn to the sector's resilience across economic cycles, strong research and development (R&D) pipelines, and the increasing demand for specialized, high-purity inputs. As drug development becomes more complex, these chemical suppliers have been viewed as critical partners, commanding pricing power and long-term contracts. Of note, Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) acquired Biovectra, a Canada-based contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) that specializes in biologics and other molecules for targeted therapeutics, in July 2024 for $925 million, equivalent to 8.2x EV/Revenue. Biovectra recently completed a $90 million expansion increasing vaccine and therapeutic production capacity by 160 million doses per year, and fill/finish capacity by 70 million doses per year, according to a news release.3 This strategic positioning, and those like it, has led to elevated multiples compared to the broader Specialty Chemicals space, making them attractive targets for both strategics and private equity.\n\nPharmaceutical companies have applied AI to accelerate drug discovery, optimize molecular design, and analyze vast datasets from genomics and clinical trials. Recursion Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq:RXRX) has emerged as a large pharmaceutical company leveraging AI to accelerate drug discovery and reduce development risk. In August 2024, Recursion acquired Exscientia, a U.K.-based AI drug discovery firm, for $339.8 million and 12.7x EV/Revenue. Exscientia's AI platform applies deep learning and advanced data analytics to rapidly identify and optimize molecules, cutting the early-stage R&D cycle significantly. The combined company expects to read out approximately 10 clinical trials in the next 18 months, focusing on high-value areas such as oncology and immunology, where drug development is typically long and costly, according to a press release.4 By integrating machine learning (ML) and AI into its discovery process, Recursion expects to improve hit rates, lower attrition, and speed time-to-market. This convergence of AI and drug development has fueled M&A, with large pharmaceutical players acquiring biotechnology and specialty chemical firms that offer proprietary platforms, AI-driven R&D, or novel delivery systems—giving them faster access to innovation and pipeline diversification in a competitive therapeutic landscape.\n\nPrivate Equity Platform Acquisitions Uplift a Rather Muted M&A Backdrop\n\nPrivate equity has benefitted from chemical companies' sticky customer relationships and the ability to pass through raw material costs as this enhances earnings visibility—a critical element for future exits. Private equity firms have namely focused on add-on acquisitions (28.6% of deals to date), with an added imperative for portfolio companies providing plastics and specialty chemicals to the Healthcare and Industrials industries. These hot spots offer a high degree of defensibility against inflation and volatile market conditions. Private equity transactions have increased as a proportion of total deals, comprising 47.6% of YTD sector deals, the highest in Capstone's record as confident deployments of elevated dry powder return to the market. Private equity firms have increasingly established platforms in the Chemicals sector to capitalize on its fragmentation, recurring demand, and pricing power. Platform acquisitions have continued to represent an increasing proportion of sector deal volume—rising to 19.5%, its highest share to date since Capstone began tracking Chemicals M&A volume in 2018. By acquiring a foothold in specialty or performance chemicals—often through a mid-sized, high-margin businesses—firms have been able to build scale through add-on acquisitions, rationalize operations, and expand geographic or end-market reach. Active and new platform investments are expected to drive an influx of sponsor-backed acquisitions amid loosening credit markets, an essential ingredient for an M&A rebound in the sector. Several notable platform transactions in the Chemicals market are highlighted below.\n\nGemspring Capital to Acquire Goodyear's Polymer Chemicals Business (May 2025, $650 Million) – Gemspring Capital announced the acquisition of The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company's (Nasdaq:GT) Polymer Chemicals business for an enterprise value of $650 million, valuing business at approximately 0.7x EV/Revenue and 5.0x EV/EBITDA (May 2025). The acquisition includes two operating plants located in Houston and Beaumont, Texas, and a R&D facility located in Akron, Ohio. Goodyear Chemical produces synthetic rubber, offering a broad product portfolio in North America and serving the Automotive Aftermarket space as well as Consumer and Industrial end markets. Gemspring anticipates unlocking the full potential of Goodyear Chemical as a standalone business and will support growth and innovation while Goodyear maintains its assets in Niagara Falls, New York, and Bayport, Texas, and its rights to the products produced at those facilities.\n\n\"We are excited to advance Goodyear Chemical's industry positioning by leveraging our strategic, financial, and industry expertise to continue delivering world-class elastomer technologies and engineered solutions to our customers. As a standalone entity, [Goodyear Chemical] will be well positioned to accelerate product development, expand its relationships with existing and new customers globally, deliver sustainable solutions, continue to invest in its people, and drive growth and innovation through commercial, technical, and operational excellence,\" said Tesham Gor, a Gemspring Executive Advisor, in a deal press release.5\n\nSky Peak Capital Partners Acquires TriStar Plastics (April 2025, Undisclosed) – Sky Peak Capital, a Boston, Massachusetts-based investment firm acquired TriStar Plastics, a provider of engineered plastic solutions and self-lubricating bearings in April (undisclosed). The company delivers a full suite of engineering services, including component design, material selection, prototyping, and production manufacturing. Its proprietary product lines—Rulon®, Ultracomp®, CJ Bearings, and TriSteel™—serve critical sectors such as Aerospace, Defense, Medical, and Food Processing.\n\n\"TriStar represents the second platform in our portfolio of enduring industrial partnerships. We continue to be excited about both the organic and M&A growth opportunities in our target markets, particularly with our high-quality, like-minded, and dedicated institutional capital partners behind us. We believe U.S. industrial businesses are poised for a renaissance and Sky Peak is well positioned to be at the forefront of supporting the next chapter of American dynamism,\" said Mike Burke, Founder and Managing Partner of Sky Peak Capital, in a deal press release.6\n\nPPC Investment Partners to Acquire Buckman Laboratories International (March 2025, Undisclosed) – In March, Pritzker Private Capital (PPC) announced the acquisition of Buckman, a family-owned innovator in specialty solutions for water treatment and industrial processes for an undisclosed sum. Buckman serves the world's largest ingredients, chemicals and industrial companies with proven solutions for water processing, paper and packaging recycling, and real-time digital tools to monitor and regulate product dosing. PPC cites Buckman's global scale, commitment to digital innovation, and an integrated, customer-centric service delivery model as key rationale for the transaction. PPC also acquired Americhem, a manufacturer of custom color masterbatch, performance additive, and engineered compound solutions, which PPC expects to leverage its diversified, long-term base of more than 1,500 customers globally (February 2025, undisclosed), according to a press release.7\n\nThe U.S. Chemical sector's favorable conditions, including low energy costs and a strong market presence in the Life Sciences segment, have continued to make it an attractive landscape for M&A activities. Divestitures have become commonplace as sellers look to realign balance sheets and buyers seek discounted assets. Capstone anticipates that companies that successfully navigate the complexities introduced by tariffs, industrial onshoring and global energy market dynamics will be long-term winners.\n\nTo discuss the advantages of the domestication and consolidation of supply chains by chemical players, provide an update on your business, or learn about Capstone's wide range of advisory services and Chemicals market knowledge, please contact us.\n\nNeve Adler, Analyst, was the lead Market Intelligence contributor to this article.\n\nEndnotes\n\nGlobal Newswire, \"Shell Plc 4th Quarter 2024 and Full Year Unaudited Results,\" https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/01/30/3017728/0/en/SHELL-PLC-4th-QUARTER-2024-AND-FULL-YEAR-UNAUDITED-RESULTS.html, accessed June 6, 2025.\n\nChemicals Week, \"Borealis, Borouge, Nova to Merge into Polyolefins Powerhouse,\" https://chemweek.mydigitalpublication.com/articles/borealis-borouge-nova-to-merge-into-polyolefins-powerhouse, accessed June 6, 2025.\n\nGenetic Engineering & Biotechnology News, \"Agilent to Acquire Biovectra for $925M, Expanding CDMO Portfolio,\" https://www.genengnews.com/topics/bioprocessing/agilent-to-acquire-biovectra-for-925m-expanding-cdmo-portfolio/, accessed June 6, 2025.\n\nRecursion, \"Recursion and Exscientia Enter Definitive Agreement to Create a Global Technology-Enabled Drug Discovery Leader with End-to-End Capabilities,\" https://ir.recursion.com/news-releases/news-release-details/recursion-and-exscientia-enter-definitive-agreement-create, accessed June 6, 2025.\n\nGemspring, \"Gemspring Capital to Acquire Goodyear Chemical,\" https://www.gemspring.com/gemspring-capital-to-acquire-goodyear-chemical/, accessed June 6, 2025.\n\nSky Peak Capital, \"Sky Peak Capital Announces its Latest Partnership with the Acquisition of TriStar Plastics,\" https://www.skypeakcap.com/blog/2025/04/29/sky-peak-capital-announces-its-latest-partnership-with-the-acquisition-of-tristar-plastics/, accessed June 6, 2025.\n\nPritzker Private Capital, \"Pritzker Private Capital Agrees to Acquire Buckman,\" https://www.ppcpartners.com/news, accessed June 6, 2025.",

      "description": "By Jaspreet Singh and Aditya Soni\n\n( ) -It's crunch time for Mark Zuckerberg as he pulls out all the stops to stay relevant in Silicon Valley's intensifying advanced artificial intelligence race.\n\nThe Meta CEO has sparked a billion-dollar talent war, aggressively poaching researchers from rivals including OpenAI. But as Meta's spending rises, so does the pressure it faces to deliver returns.\n\nFor the second quarter, though, Wall Street is bracing for disappointment as the company is set to report its slowest profit growth in two years on Wednesday, rising by 11.5% to $15.01 billion, as operating costs jump nearly 9%.\n\nRevenue, too, likely grew at its slowest pace in seven quarters in that period, up an expected 14.7% to $44.80 billion, according to an average analyst estimate from LSEG.\n\nWhile Zuckerberg is no stranger to high-stakes pursuits - Meta's augmented-reality unit has burned more than $60 billion since 2020 - his latest push comes with added urgency because of the underwhelming performance of the company's large language Llama 4 model.\n\nHe recently pledged hundreds of billions of dollars to build massive AI data centers and shelled out $14.3 billion for a stake in startup Scale AI, poaching its 28-year-old billionaire CEO Alexandr Wang, even as Meta continued to lay off people.\n\nInvestors have largely backed Zuckerberg's frenzied pursuit of superintelligence - a hypothetical concept where AI surpasses human intelligence in every possible way - pushing the company's stock up more than a fifth so far this year. \n\nBut they will watch if Meta further increases its capital expenditure for the year after boosting it in April. Alphabet also upped the ante last week, increasing its annual capex forecast by 13% to $85 billion due to surging demand for its AI-powered Google Cloud services.\n\n\"We view rising capex as positive given... Meta can become a one-stop shop for many marketing departments,\" said Ben Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot, which holds Meta shares. \n\nLagging efforts from Alphabet's Google DeepMind and OpenAI, Meta launched a Superintelligence Lab last month that will work in parallel to Meta AI, the company's established AI research division, led by deep learning pioneer, Yann LeCun. \n\nTo differentiate its efforts, Zuckerberg has promised to release Meta's AI work as open source and touted that superintelligence can become a mainstream consumer product through devices like Ray-Ban Meta smartglasses, rather than a purely enterprise-focused technology.\n\nThe strategy plays to Meta's strengths, analysts say, pointing to its more than 3-billion strong social media user base and engagement gains in recent years, driven by AI-enhanced content targeting.\n\nStill, Meta's mainstay advertising market is under threat from advertisers pulling back spending in the face of President Donald Trump's tariffs, and tough competition from Chinese-owned TikTok, whose U.S. ban now seems unlikely.  \n\nSome advertisers may have leaned on proven platforms such as Meta amid the uncertainty, but that will not shield the company from questions over its superintelligence ambitions and how they fit into its broader business strategy, said Minda Smiley, senior analyst at eMarketer.\n\n\"While Meta has seen massive gains from incorporating AI into its ad platform and algorithms, its attempts to directly compete with the likes of OpenAI are proving to be more challenging while costing it billions of dollars.\"\n\nQuestions remain about when superintelligence can be achieved, a timeline Zuckerberg admits is uncertain. Meta's LeCun is also a known skeptic of the large language model path to superintelligence.\n\n\"Meta's AI strategy today is more cohesive than in 2023, but there's still a sense the company is still searching for direction,\" MoffettNathanson analysts said.\n\nSign up to receive the latest updates from U.S. News & World Report and our trusted partners and sponsors.

      "description": "Special Ops has long held its place as one of India's most gripping and popular espionage franchises. So when Special Ops 2.0 was announced, it set off a wave of excitement among fans and chatter across the internet. With fans waiting eagerly, JioHotstar made sure the return of Himmat Singh was nothing short of spectacular — bigger in scale, sharper in story, and more powerful in impact.\n\nThis season takes the Special Ops franchise into uncharted territory, exploring the dark and dangerous world of cyber warfare where espionage isn't just about spies and shootouts anymore, but about data, deception, and digital traps. In today's always-connected world, the threats have become more personal and invisible. It's no longer just about national security; it's about your phone being hacked, your identity being stolen, or your bank account being wiped out in seconds. Kay Kay Menon returns as the unflinching RAW officer Himmat Singh, but this time, he's up against a new kind of enemy, one that hides behind screens, uses AI to manipulate reality, and strikes without warning.\n\nLeaning into this theme, the campaign didn't just promote the show, it sparked important conversations about the digital dangers we all face every day. Through immersive storytelling and relatable insights, it created awareness about how everyday people, not just intelligence officers, can fall victim to phishing scams, deepfakes, online fraud, and data breaches. It served as a wake-up call, reminding viewers that cyber threats are real, growing, and often just one careless click away. By grounding a high-stakes thriller in real-world risks, the campaign made Special Ops 2.0 not just entertaining but urgently relevant.What followed was a high-impact 360-degree campaign that left no stone unturned — from brand partnerships and tech-led experiences to engaging narratives around potential data breaches and digital red flags. The campaign tapped into multiple touchpoints, including social media, content creators, and real-time consumer engagement, making the threat of cybercrime feel closer, more urgent, and deeply relatable. By grounding a high-stakes thriller in real-world risks, the campaign made Special Ops 2.0 not just entertaining but a sharp reflection of the world we live in today.\n\nA First-of-Its-Kind: AI-Powered Personalisation at City Scale\n\nAmong the most impactful elements of this 360-degree rollout was a first-of-its-kind AI-powered innovation that delivered hyper-personalised, pincode-targeted trailers, where viewers heard Himmat Singh mention their own locality before the story even began.\n\nThis large-scale localisation push across key metros used automation and AI to create customised trailer versions based on where each user lived, turning a standard trailer launch into a more personal and relevant viewing experience.\n\nThe initiative reached over 10 million users, building a deeper emotional connection and making the theme of cyber warfare feel immediate and relatable, while also sparking organic conversations across social media and digital communities.\n\nPurpose-Driven Brand Integrations That Echoed the Storyline\n\nWith a powerful blend of sponsorships and partnerships, Special Ops 2 on JioHotstar launched with strong brand momentum across key categories — from automotive, technology, finance, and FMCG to QSR, luxury, personal care, and building materials. \n\nThe sponsor lineup included Hyundai, Jaquar & Co, Directors Elaichi, Asian Paints, UTI Mutual Fund, Envy, Philips, Lux Industries, Domino's, JK Cement, Oppo, Swiggy, Toothsi, and Sony Bravia — a testament to the show's mass appeal and cross-category relevance.\n\nTo drive home the urgency of cyber threats, the campaign partnered with platforms that are part of India's everyday digital life. Each collaboration spotlighted a specific risk, turning the show's central theme into a broader public conversation around digital safety.\n\nWhatsApp (Meta-powered PSA): Kay Kay Menon appeared in a video promoting secure digital payment practices, educating users about scams and frauds during UPI transactions.\n\nTruecaller Integration: Creative assets on the app highlighted threats like impersonation and spoofed calls, mirroring the show's focus on cybercrime.\n\nPaytm Collaboration: This partnership focused on safe UPI usage through in-app messages, PR and social amplification, and contextual cues at transaction points.\n\nBy leveraging Himmat Singh's strong recall, these partnerships made the message more relatable and relevant. More than promotion, they served a purpose using entertainment to educate users about real digital dangers.\n\nExperiential Moments That Brought the Threat Closer to Home\n\nThe campaign created real-world experiences that immersed audiences in the universe of Special Ops 2.0, making the digital threat feel immediate and personal.\n\nOne of the standout moments was the press conference, styled like an intelligence debriefing rather than a traditional media event. The cast arrived with high security, the venue was designed to feel like a classified briefing room, and key visuals from the show were woven into the setup. The experience amplified the narrative of urgency and digital danger while also serving as the official launchpad for the campaign's key messages around cyber threats.\n\nIn a powerful display of crossover between fiction and national identity, the cast of Special Ops 2.0 attended the Change of Guard ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhavan, saluting the real-world defenders of the nation. Another activation brought them face to face with the country's cybercrime task force at the Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre, underscoring the urgency and truth behind the show's narrative. The initiatives resulted in over 850 earned media stories across quality media and platforms.\n\nTogether, these on-ground experiences helped the campaign blur the lines between fiction and reality and brought audiences deeper into the world of Special Ops 2.0.\n\nTurning Social Media into a Learning Playground\n\nOn social media, the campaign moved beyond traditional content drops to immersive and interactive storytelling that mirrored the show's core themes. Fuelling speculation and excitement online, a supposed \"leak\" of JioHotstar's upcoming show lineup (complete with episode previews) quickly went viral after fans shared a circulated document link. But what seemed like a careless slip by the platform turned out to be a cleverly disguised PSA. Clicking on any of the preview links redirected users to an unlisted video featuring Kay Kay Menon and Vinay Pathak in an intense sequence that ended with a direct message warning viewers about the dangers of phishing links and the risks of accessing unverified content. The social media stunt reached more than 22.4M audience and secured an engagement of more than 1.4M across social media platforms. The YT PSA video from the \"leaked\" document ended up receiving more than 86K views.\n\nThis approach turned a simple click into an unexpected, cinematic moment of learning, a bold blend of entertainment and cyber-awareness. In another activation titled Threat Alert, a cryptic clue posted by Tahir Raj Bhasin challenged fans to decode a message. Those who cracked the code received a personalised video from the actor, blurring the lines between fiction and reality, and drawing fans deeper into the Special Ops universe. Shared through Instagram DMs the video saw an opening rate of engagement by 73.4%. The posts reached over 23.3M people and saw more than 280K interact with it.\n\nThis social chatter was further built through a UGC activation – YEH HIMMAT KA KAAM HAI – turning Himmat into a cultural movement.  It kicked off with a powerful poetic monologue by Kay Kay Menon, culminating in the line \"Yeh Himmat Ka Kaam Hai.\" This became a rallying cry across social platforms, inspiring audiences and creators to share their own stories of courage. What began as a brand line quickly evolved into a movement, amassing over 3 million views and 13,000+ organic engagements, and turning Himmat into a cultural icon.\n\nEach social media beat was designed as \"experience-as-education\" – engaging digital natives through curiosity, surprise, and smart storytelling that made the show's themes of cyber threats and digital espionage feel real and relatable.\n\nDisrupting Primetime: A Television-Led Launch Strategy\n\nTo dominate attention across screens, Special Ops 2 rolled out a disruptive television campaign engineered to capture audiences during the most-viewed slots. A 3-day megablast flooded Hindi movie channels with top and tail ads placed in every break, alongside high-impact squeeze-ups integrated seamlessly within content — delivering unmissable visibility that reached over 36 million viewers during the weekend. \n\nSimultaneously, a first-of-its-kind editorial takeover on leading Hindi news channels turned primetime into a narrative-led build-up to the series. Titled 'Special Ops', the segments featured real-life Indian defence missions, hosted by top anchors and subtly connected to the show's theme with smartly embedded cues. This blend of content and context delivered a powerful, immersive storytelling experience that blurred the line between fiction and real-world valour – capturing the attention of over 35 million viewers across five days.\n\n At a time when Indian audiences are navigating digital anxiety and the constant threat of online scams, Special Ops 2.0 grounded its entire communication strategy in real-world relevance. From cyber awareness and civic vigilance to national pride, the campaign blurred the lines between storytelling and social responsibility.\n\nPost Views",

      "description": "-\n\nN‑able, Inc. (NYSE: NABL), a global software company delivering a unified cyber resiliency platform, today launched its first annual 2025 threat report, exploring the rise in cyberattacks on small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) ranging from 100-2,500 employees. The report uncovers a dramatic rise in detected threats across SMBs, from approximately 48,749 in June 2024 to over 13.3 million by June 2025, as they increasingly invest in the proper security tools to monitor their environments and mitigate risk.\n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250729130190/en/ While many SMBs have long assumed they're too small to be targeted by cybercriminals, new data from N-able shows that perception is rapidly changing. Threat actors are increasingly favoring quicker, low-effort attacks on SMBs over complex enterprise breaches, exploiting limited defenses for faster payoffs. The N-able unified platform is designed to help SMBs level the playing field by delivering enterprise-grade visibility, protection, and response capabilities tailored to their unique needs.\n\n\"Legacy security controls don't keep pace with the challenges faced by today's SMB,\" said Kevin O'Connor, Director of Threat Research at N-able. \"Adversaries are constantly developing and deploying attacks that exploit common gaps in visibility and response. SMBs need solutions that deliver coverage across the threat lifecycle and fit within operational constrains – exactly what N-able provides.\"\n\nUsing data from the N-able ecosystem, the N-able threat research team revealed the following:\n\nCybercriminals are targeting small and midsized businesses more thanever: Attackers are no longer skipping over smaller businesses — in fact, they're increasingly targeting them.\nAI is supercharging social engineering: Attackers are leveraging generative AI to create convincing phishing messages that resemble real people and writing styles. Certain messages are even able to fool the most tech-savvy of employees.\nRansomware remains a significant threat: The pervasive impact of ransomware accounted for nearly 1.9 million detections in the first half of 2025 observed by the team.\n\n\"The findings align closely with what we're seeing, the pace of change in cybersecurity is relentless. It's easy to get caught up in the complexity of today's landscape: AI-driven threats, ransomware attacks, evolving regulations, and a flood of new tools and technologies. But real success comes from going back to the basics. Things like maintaining patches, ensuring reliable backups, continuous monitoring, endpoint protection, and having clear processes in place – businesses can't afford to operate in reactive mode,\" said Vinod Paul, President at Align. \"When we stay grounded in the basics, we're in the best position to protect our clients and build lasting trust. We trust N-able as a partner that delivers on the promise of cybersecurity.\"\n\nN-able will demonstrate its unified platform—purpose-built to address threats across every stage of the attack lifecycle at Black Hat 2025, taking place August 5–7 at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. The platform integrates cyber resilience across endpoint management, security operations and backup and data protection. Attendees can visit the N-able team at Booth #3064.\n\nTo view the full report, please visit https://www.n-able.com/resources/threat-report-2025.\n\nAbout N‑able\n\nAt N‑able, our mission is to protect businesses against evolving cyberthreats with a unified cyber resiliency platform to manage, secure, and recover. Our scalable technology infrastructure includes AI-powered capabilities, market-leading third-party integrations, and the flexibility to employ technologies of choice—to transform workflows and deliver critical security outcomes.

      "description": "(© MicroStockHub - Canva.com )\n\nIf business leaders only consider the obvious threats from tariffs, they could be blindsided by less obvious and arguably more serious problems. Let's dive into the deeper and easily overlooked fallout that might emerge from tariffs, and the opportunities that come with addressing them.\n\nHow tariffs shake up supply chains and trade\n\nThe global economy is a fragile, deeply complex and interconnected ecosystem with countless interdependencies, many of which only surface when something breaks.\n\nMargins are often razor-thin and depend on infrastructure, trade relationships, and processes that have been built and honed over years and decades.\n\nThe pricing system enables businesses to make informed decisions and coordinate their demand, supply, and logistics to remain profitable and competitive.\n\nTariffs, reciprocal tariffs, and retaliatory restrictions and regulations create shockwaves that hit businesses and then ripple through the system. They affect nearly every party in the supply chain, including manufacturers, distributors, suppliers, carriers, retailers, and customers. These parties react in turn, expanding the circle of chaos. Trading partners that were economical before tariffs came into effect may no longer be so. Factories staffed by experts and surrounded by synergetic suppliers may no longer be feasible.\n\nThe neglect of high-value intangibles\n\nWith all the chaos induced by tariffs, leaders' focus has been wrenched from their most important tasks — business strategy, innovation, driving key initiatives, and making important operational decisions. Now it is redirected to dealing with the bureaucracy, fallout, and subsequent uncertainty of tariffs. This will certainly reduce the quantity and quality of future innovation and progress.\n\nThe higher costs on supplies and products due to tariffs will be siphoned from the rest of the economy, leaving less available capital. Add to this the considerable uncertainty that trade wars generate, and there is likely to be a significant slowdown, if not a freeze, in investments, further reducing the amount available for research and development and impacting innovation.\n\nProduct selection may shrink as brands withdraw less profitable products from markets—or even withdraw entirely from markets. And closely connected to that is the potential for rising customer dissatisfaction and switching loyalty.\n\nWhenever prices are artificially inflated due to taxes, tariffs, or outright embargoes, there is a rising risk of theft, black markets, smuggling, and counterfeit products emerging. This is difficult to combat, and counterfeit products can seriously harm a brand.\n\nWhat can business leaders and organizations do?\n\nBesides preparing to deal with tariffs, businesses can take a few more strategic and powerful actions.\n\nAs prices rise and business transactions slow, cost optimization at all levels is crucial. However, businesses should also prepare to seize opportunities as they arise.\n\nPerhaps the single biggest thing companies can do is to accelerate the digitization of their supply chains to deal with volatility, latency, and inefficiency more effectively. In Blue Yonder's 2025 Supply Chain Compass Research Survey, 82% of leaders agreed that outdated technology will hinder their supply chain's potential. Undoubtedly true. The biggest opportunity here is for companies to modernize their entire supply chain using a multi-enterprise network-based approach, as they compete with their network of supply chain partners.\n\nA single, network-based platform for the entire supply chain ecosystem means each trading partner can optimize internally and orchestrate globally with partners, using interoperable cloud-based solutions specifically designed to work together for maximum efficiency. It facilitates end-to-end visibility across the supply chain network, speeds up collaborative decision-making, while lowering waste and costs at every node and link in the supply chain, leading to dramatic savings that can offset tariff costs.\n\nBy leveraging a digital supply chain network, organizations can gain an unprecedented ability to execute the SADA loop — see, analyze, decide, and act — much faster and more effectively. This is because they will have all the relevant and timely data from across the supply chain, enabling better analysis and decision-making in synchronization with trading partners.\n\nCreate competitive advantage through unprecedented network-wide visibility to orders, inventory, shipments, and product origin. This will enable companies to see, not just where product is now, or its final assembly point, but the origin of materials and components that went into the product. This chain-of-custody is vital information when mitigating the effects of tariffs. With the threat of black markets emerging as product prices rise, this visibility will enable companies to bolster the security of their supply chain.\n\nCompanies should consider using product authentication to mark and track products at the source and across the supply chain. A supply chain command center that monitors shipments across the network can help detect suspicious activity that could indicate product diversion, switching, or theft. It can alert companies to unusual shipment delays, missed milestones, and unplanned stops, which can indicate that the product is being tampered with. (Traceability can also help with sustainability, ensuring the product is sourced from the appropriate certified, compliant suppliers.)\n\nEnsure supply chain systems are interoperable. With planning and execution cycles needing to shrink to address rapid market shifts, companies must analyze changes, understand the impact of decisions, and make decisions quickly. Plans need to adapt quickly to changing conditions and operational feedback to remain optimal and feasible. Interoperable planning and execution systems across demand and supply, as well as transportation and warehouse management, can compress long cycles and unlock greater agility, efficiency, and value.\n\nRun what-if scenarios and use AI to help balance the costs, benefits, and tradeoffs. What-if scenarios are powerful analysis, decision, and action tools. Companies that digitize their supply chain network on a common platform will find such scenario planning to be far more powerful, as they can include trading partners in planning, get alignment, and quickly deploy differentiated plans across tariff-sensitive and tariff-immune product segments in their portfolio.\n\nAdapt quickly with speed and precision by leveraging technology\n\nBusiness leaders need to look at the big picture, long-term, while considering the important details and all the hidden costs (including the time and the cost of fully implementing changes). Bear in mind that tariffs might come and go rapidly, potentially making an expensive reshore move unnecessary in a year or two. So don't rush or commit to big changes that are expensive and difficult to reverse.\n\nOn the other hand, it's difficult to over-invest in modernizing supply chain technology. Such an investment in improved efficiency, resilience, and security will pay back regardless of whether tariffs are in force or not. It will lower costs across the supply chain and help organizations better manage volatility and respond more effectively to disruptions, regardless of their source.\n\nTechnology that can help evaluate the full end-to-end supply chain, factoring in the many cost tradeoffs and what-if scenario plans, that can track the chain of custody of products, and minimize tampering and theft, is invaluable. And it's a huge advantage whether tariffs go up, down, or away completely. Your customers will thank you regardless.",

Let's dive in. \n AI Updates   The founders of Bloodhound Books have launched an AI fiction translation company. I am not a translator, but I know that translation is a legitimate art form that requires nuance and expertise to do well. This feels like feeding text into Google Translate and calling it a book.  Letting AI do our writing reduces our capacity for the best kind of human thinking, and the timing couldn't be worse.  Which workers will AI hurt the most?  A judge has ruled that \"three writers suing Anthropic for copyright infringement can represent all other authors whose books the AI company allegedly pirated to train its AI model as part of a class action lawsuit.\"  A recent Senate hearing debates AI's training on copyrighted works.  ChatGPT is changing the words we use in conversation.  BookTok creators share their thoughts on Character.AI, a chatbot that allows users to \"talk\" online with book characters.  A creative writing teacher looks at what AI is doing to students.   Trump vs. Publishing, Libraries, and Everything Else   Checking in on federal library funding.  Meanwhile, Wisconsin is putting together a statewide postcard campaign for library users to tell federal officials why public library funding needs to be protected.  Trump has announced 30% tariffs on the European Union and Mexico.  The DOJ is pursuing legal options against newspapers and social media platforms that \"deprioritize misinformation\" (aka prioritizing fact-checking). The claim is that they could violate US antitrust law \"if they exclude rivals or lead to anticompetitive effects.\"  Conservatives get the PBS and NPR cuts they've wanted for decades.  PBS and NPR are being defunded. But where are the publishers?   Censorship Updates   The Naval Academy has settled on a shorter list of banned books as the court battle to remove hundreds of titles from Defense Department schools continues.  Related: what's included in the 596 books banned by the DoD Education Activity?  New Hampshire governor Kelly Ayotte has vetoed a bill that would have allowed parents to request that certain materials be removed from their child's school.  The Virginia Joint Legislative and Audit Review Commission (JLARC) has found that some Virginia school districts are misinterpreting a 2022 law to justify the removal of certain titles.  \"The state board governing Alabama libraries plans to amend its administrative code to add language effectively prohibiting positive descriptions of 'transgender procedures' or 'the concept of more than two biological genders' in material for children and youth.\" I am fully aware that the Alabama Public Service Library Board has been taken over by right-wing bigots, but hearing this type of rhetoric come from a library institution makes me very sad. And former board president Ron Snider agrees: \"'I'm afraid that Alabama Public Library Service is being used as a platform to boost your own positions to the detriment of the libraries of this state.'\"  The Lafayette Public Library board (LA) has voted to settle a free speech lawsuit from 2023.  The Livingston Parish (LA) library director was removed by the board for what some say are due to political reasons. This is further emphasized by the fact that after the board voted to remove the director, the four board members who voted to retain the director immediately resigned.

      "description": "Unless you know the correct tactics, \"How to train a Machine Learning model\" could become a bigger question than \"How to train a dragon\"… !! <p> I have often seen, a lot of people taking interest in getting their hands dirty by training models for various tasks, in which they demonstrate the high quality of model by reporting a high accuracy on the training and the test data. But people who are new to the domain often fail to validate the model, which is very crucial if your model is going to be used in production on a previously unseen data. Many people are not aware of how and why to validate. Without proper validation, you may get good results on in-house settings but the model could fail in the production.</p> <p> Let's discuss why validation is necessary and how to validate a machine learning model and how it can help in a better performance in production.</p> <p> Why is test data required?</p> <p> First let's understand the significance of the test data. Assume that you have a dataset of image classification and you want to train a model which will recognize which object is the image of, say dog, cat, elephant, etc. Suppose we train our model on the complete dataset till we are satisfied that our model has a high accuracy on the training dataset. Can we release this model to the production?</p> <p> Absolutely No. This is because when we fine tune the model to the training dataset, it perfectly learns the patterns and trends in the training dataset and gives high accuracy, but in this process, it could lose what's called \"generalization ability\". So, it might not perform well on the unseen data. This is called as \"overfitting\". To avoid this, it is necessary to have a separate data called test data to keep checking the accuracy on the unseen data. In general, if we plot the accuracy graphs of training and test datasets, across the level of fine-tuning, it will look somewhat like as shown in Figure 2.</p> <p> What we can see here is, testing data accuracy increases with training data accuracy up to some level of fine-tuning, but with more fine-tuning, it starts decreasing even though, training data accuracy is still increasing. This is the point, where the model has started to overfit. We need to catch this point, where training data and test data both are as high as possible and stop the training to get a model which can perform well on the unseen data. So, this is the logic behind having a test dataset and to report its accuracy rather than training data accuracy.</p> <p> Why is Validation of model required?</p> <p> Above logic looks good. However, in real world, it is often seen that, the test dataset accuracy is high for a model, but it still performs poorly on the unseen production data. This happens because the method discussed above has a flaw. The catch here is that, we kept checking the accuracy of the test data while fine-tuning the model. Which means, the test data is not an \"unseen data\" anymore for the model. It has been indirectly used for training the model. Hence, even though, we reported the test data accuracy, it's not representative of the accuracy of \"unseen data\". In fact, it could have been overfit to the test data now. Hence, it is necessary to have a validation phase before putting a trained model into the production.</p> <p> How to perform validation?</p> <p> It's very simple. Instead of dividing data into training and test dataset, it is usually divided into 3 categories — training data, validation data and test data. The validation data is used for fine tuning the model along with the training data according to process above. The test data is used purely to report the accuracy of the trained model. Note that, in this approach, test data comes into picture only after complete fine-tuning and training of model and hence, it is never seen by the model during training. So, the accuracy on this test data truly represents performance on the unseen data. Hence, if this accuracy is poor, we should refrain from pushing the model to the production.</p> <p> So now we know how to validate a machine learning model. Next time you take a machine learning project, make sure to validate the model and then report true test accuracy. This will make sure your project runs well in the production.</p>",

      "description": "The artificial intelligence sector in China has entered a new phase intensifying AI competition with the United States, as Chinese megacities launch massive subsidy programmes. At the same time, domestic firms are hoping to reduce their dependence on US technology. The stakes extend far beyond technological supremacy, with both nations viewing AI dominance as critical to future economic and strategic power.\n\nShanghai's US$139 million AI investment gambit\n\nShanghai has unveiled an ambitious one billion yuan (US$139 million) subsidy programme for its artificial intelligence industry, marking the latest in the technological race as major cities in China engage in fierce AI competition for dominance.\n\nThe comprehensive package allocates resources in three key areas: 600 million yuan for computing power subsidies, 300 million yuan for third-party AI model discounts, and 100 million yuan to support companies in procuring training datasets.\n\nThe programme offers subsidy rates ranging from 10% to 100% of contract values for computing facilities, AI models, and datasets, according to documents released by the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Economy and Informatisation. The city plans to offer up to 500 million yuan to new AI research institutions, with funding guaranteed for three to five years.\n\n\"One of Shanghai's key advantages in AI development is its strong funding,\" said Pan Helin, a member of an expert committee under China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. However, Pan noted that Shanghai's high operating costs often push AI start-ups toward cheaper alternatives like nearby Hangzhou.\n\nNationwide competition heats up\n\nShanghai's initiative reflects a broader pattern in China, where cities are competing aggressively to establish AI dominance in what has become an intense inter-city competition. Hangzhou has emerged as a particular rival, having announced plans last year to distribute 250 million yuan in computing power subsidies while nurturing its \"six little dragons\" – a collection of well-known Chinese start-ups, including AI player DeepSeek.\n\nThe inter-city rivalry extends beyond Shanghai and Hangzhou, with Shenzhen, Chengdu, and Beijing also introducing similar support measures. This situation demonstrates how artificial intelligence has become a strategic priority at multiple levels of Chinese government – domestic AI competition in China.\n\nTrump's AI strategy maintains pressure\n\nThe timing of Shanghai's announcement coincides with the Trump administration's comprehensive AI Action Plan, unveiled on July 23. The 28-page strategy maintains tight restrictions on key technologies while accelerating deregulation and infrastructure support for US AI companies.\n\nDonald Trump described the plan as \"a policy of the United States to do whatever it takes to lead the world in artificial intelligence,\" emphasising America's intention to become an \"AI export powerhouse\" and maintain national security protections.\n\nThe plan tasks the US Commerce Department with closing loopholes in current export restrictions, boosting oversight of end users abroad, and a plan to explore geolocation tools to block access to \"countries of concern\" like China.\n\nChina's self-reliance strategy shows results\n\nDespite US restrictions, analysts predict significant growth for China's domestic AI industry. Bernstein analysts led by Lin Qingyuan forecast that domestic chips will capture 55% of China's AI accelerator market by 2027, up dramatically from just 17% in 2023.\n\n\"Export controls have created a unique opportunity for domestic AI chip vendors, as they are not competing with the most advanced global alternatives,\" the Bernstein research note said.\n\nThe growth reflects ongoing technological progress, with Chinese companies increasingly matching the performance of downgraded chips sold to China. Huawei's Ascend 910C now reaches approximately 65% of Nvidia's supreme H100 capacity, though its computing power remains limited by lack of direct compatibility with Nvidia's CUDA software platform.\n\nGeopolitical implications and future outlook\n\nBo Zhengyuan of Plenum, an independent China-focused research platform, argues that Trump's approach represents a shift from Biden's containment strategy to more direct competition. \"So far, the 'yard' hasn't gotten any smaller,\" Bo noted, according to a South China Morning Post article, referring to export control scope. \"What's different is the rhetoric – it's now more head-to-head than containment.\"\n\nThe AI competition between China and the US appears set to intensify further, so much so that at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, Premier Li Qiang called for international cooperation to ensure AI does not become an \"exclusive game\" accessible only to a select few – a clear reference to US restrictions.\n\nHowever, neither US pressure nor Chinese subsidies guarantees clear winners in this technological race. \"AI isn't something that can be built overnight through policy support alone – it's a long game shaped by engineering, talent, and infrastructure,\" Bo said.\n\nWith China's data resources, algorithms, and AI talent remaining competitive with the US despite chip restrictions, the outcome of this technological competition may ultimately depend on which approach – American technological restrictions or Chinese self-reliance investments – proves more effective in driving innovation.\n\n\"There won't be a clear winner or loser in the next decade,\" Bo concluded, suggesting that this technological rivalry will define the AI landscape for years to come.\n\nSee also: Ren Zhengfei: China's AI future and Huawei's long game\n\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

      "description": "– National Association of Voice Actors Supports Bipartisan Bill to Protect Creators from Unauthorized AI Training –\n\nLOS ANGELES, July 29, 2025   -- The National Association of Voice Actors (NAVA), a social impact non-profit dedicated to advocating for and advancing the voice acting industry, today announced its support for the Transparency and Responsibility in AI Network (TRAIN) Act, a bipartisan bill that helps creators protect their work from the unauthorized use of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe proposed legislation arrives at a pivotal time for artists who are navigating a new reality in which AI tools are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, blurring the lines between human and synthetic creativity. The TRAIN Act would require AI companies to disclose whether copyrighted works were used to inform AI models, holding developers accountable for using creators' work.\n\n\"Accountability is key to ensuring artists aren't exploited by AI,\" said Tim Friedlander, president and co-founder of NAVA. \"We need to lay the groundwork for legislation that protects human voices and ensures a safe and fair environment for AI use.\n\n\"The TRAIN Act is an important step toward moving the AI narrative forward with transparency and responsibility.\"\n\nThe legislation is led by U.S. Senator Peter Welch (D-Vt.), along with Senate Judiciary Committee members Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Adam Schiff (D-Ca.), and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.).\n\nNAVA recently hosted a panel at San Diego Comic-Con focused on how creators are navigating the rise of AI. This followed recent advocacy wins in Washington, D.C. and Sacramento, including the successful removal of a proposed 10-year moratorium on state-level AI regulation from the so-called \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" (H.R. 1).\n\n\"This is simple: if your work is used to train AI, there should be a way for you, the copyright holder, to determine that it's been used by a training model, and you should get compensated if it was,\" Senator Welch said in a statement.\n\nThe TRAIN Act is expected to be referred to committee for further consideration.\n\nAbout NAVA\n\nThe National Association of Voice Actors is a social impact non-profit dedicated to advocating for and advancing the voice acting industry through action, education, inclusion, and benefits.

      "description": "In a historic milestone, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has become the first company to reach a staggering $4.3 trillion market valuation, eclipsing the second-largest company, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), by $500 billion -- a gap so large it is equivalent to the market caps of Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Nike (NYSE:NKE), and AT&T (NYSE:T) combined, with $80 billion to spare.\n\nThis meteoric rise, driven by Nvidia's dominance in artificial intelligence (AI) hardware, underscores its pivotal role in the tech landscape. It has evolved from a niche graphics chipmaker to the backbone of the AI revolution, fueled by its graphics processing units (GPUs) that power data centers for companies like Microsoft, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Google.\n\nSince ChatGPT's 2022 debut, NVDA stock has soared over 1,000%, reflecting Wall Street's confidence in AI's rapid growth. With global AI infrastructure spending projected to surpass $200 billion by 2028, Nvidia's trajectory seems unstoppable. Yet, as AI's potential remains in its infancy, can anything halt the Nvidia juggernaut?\n\nGrowth Potential For the Next 10 Years\n\nNvidia's growth prospects over the next decade are tied to its near-monopoly in AI chips, commanding a 90% share of the GPU market critical for AI development. Its data center revenue, which surged 73% year-over-year to $39 billion in the latest quarter, is expected to continue climbing as AI adoption accelerates across industries like healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and enterprise software.\n\nAnalysts forecast Nvidia's revenue could reach $292 billion by fiscal 2028, with one projecting a $50 trillion valuation over the next decade. Its Blackwell GPU architecture that promises to further solidify Nvidia's lead by enhancing AI and high-performance computing capabilities.\n\nBeyond data centers, Nvidia's automotive segment, already up 72% to $567 million last quarter, could hit $5 billion this year, driven by partnerships with Waymo, Mercedes, and Toyota (NYSE:TM) for autonomous driving. With AI infrastructure investments potentially reaching $5.2 trillion by 2030, Nvidia's diversified revenue streams position it for sustained growth.\n\nHoles in the Roadmap Ahead\n\nDespite its dominance, Nvidia faces significant risks. Geopolitical tensions, particularly U.S.-China trade restrictions have already cost the company $8 billion in lost sales due to export bans on its H20 chips.\n\nThe Chinese market, once a $50 billion opportunity, could see revenue erode further if restrictions are reimposed. However, Nvidia has reportedly ordered from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) 300,000 new H20 chips -- its dumbed-down AI chips for the China market -- to add to its existing stockpile of 600,000 to 700,000 H20 chips after President Trump reversed his ban on their export.\n\nCompetition is another concern, as rivals like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) develop AI chips, while tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) design in-house solutions to reduce reliance on Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nTechnical challenges, like potential overheating issues with the Blackwell architecture, could delay deployments and dent market confidence. Moreover, Nvidia's lofty valuation -- trading at 30 times forward earnings -- invites skepticism about overhyping AI's short-term returns, especially if businesses fail to see sufficient returns on the $1 trillion projected AI development costs.\n\nRegulatory scrutiny over Nvidia's market dominance could also lead to antitrust challenges, threatening its pricing power and growth trajectory.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nNvidia's unparalleled position in the AI revolution makes it a cornerstone for long-term investment portfolios. Its ability to maintain a 90% GPU market share, coupled with robust revenue growth and innovation like the Blackwell architecture, positions it to capitalize on AI's multidecade transformation.\n\nWhile risks like competition and geopolitical hurdles exist, Nvidia's diversified revenue streams and software ecosystem, including CUDA and AI Enterprise, provide a buffer to incursions on it turf. With analysts predicting a potential $5 trillion valuation by 2026 and $6 trillion by 2030 -- and maybe even $50 trillion 10 years from now -- Nvidia offers unmatched exposure to AI's exponential growth.\n\nFor investors betting on the future of technology, Nvidia is not just a stock to buy and hold forever -- it's a stake in the AI-driven world.\n\nIf You have $500,000 Saved, Retirement Could Be Closer Than You Think (sponsor)\n\nRetirement can be daunting, but it doesn't need to be.\n\nImagine having an expert in your corner to help you with your financial goals. Someone to help you determine if you're ahead, behind, or right on track. With SmartAsset, that's not just a dream—it's reality.

Professional Services is a broad field. Our primary area of focus will be broker/dealers and other white-collar Professional Services firms, particularly those that have a significant element of human capital. The most active segments of that market are accounting firms, consulting firms, and the specialized advisory market. \n \nThe Professional Services sector has been witnessing a wave of consolidation. What are some factors fueling this M&A activity? \n \nThere are several factors at play here, Marc. For starters, the space is highly fragmented. The Big 4 – Deloitte, PwC, EY and KPMG – each have over $10 billion in revenue, followed by roughly 20 firms with revenues ranging from $500 million to $5 billion, which are attractive platforms for sizable private equity firms. There is, then, a very long tail of $50 million to $500 million platforms and roll-up opportunities to support significant inorganic growth. \n \nWhat else makes Professional Services firms attractive acquisition targets? \n \nMany of these firms have a recurring business model, with plenty of room for improvement in operational efficiency. That, combined with the opportunity for inorganic growth I mentioned earlier, allows financial sponsors to underwrite a strong financial return model over a three-to-five-year hold period.  \n \nHow is Artificial Intelligence driving M&A in the space? \n \nAI is transforming many industries, and this one is no exception. For some investors, AI is the core thesis driving their interest. \n \nWe've seen venture firms looking to disrupt the space completely. While tech-focused sponsors believe they can add more value through technology, traditional financial services and human capital firms also see AI as a necessary investment to stay competitive. \n \nFrom your vantage point, where do you expect to see the most activity within Professional Services subsectors? \n \nThe exciting part is that we expect to see activity across the landscape. The business model here involves acquiring a platform, enhancing it organically, and then growing inorganically. As targets become more crowded and expensive, the scope of M&A activity will naturally expand. \n \nDo you think dealmaking is peaking, or will robust activity continue in the second half of 2025 and into 2026? \n \nThere is a lot of interest in white-collar Professional Services currently, but it is still early days. We expect several more platform transactions to happen in the coming year or two, and well-capitalized platforms will look to expand inorganically, building a highly sustainable M&A market for a significant period of time. \n \nThere's also a lot of generational turnover happening in the sector. How is that impacting the market? \n \nMany leaders who have founded or built these organizations for the past 20 to 30 years are nearing retirement, prompting succession planning and ownership transfer. These owners are deeply invested in their companies and people and want to partner with someone who will take their business to the next level while taking care of their employees. These partners are really looking for the right steward for their businesses for generations to come. \n \nThat's where I feel a firm like Solomon stands out. Sure, there are a lot of smart bankers out there who can close a deal. But what led me to join Solomon is the bankers here care deeply about their clients — in much the same way the clients care about the people they serve. \n \nThe post appeared first on Solomon Partners .",

      "description": "More than half (51%) of all customer service journeys now begin on third-party platforms such as Google, YouTube, and ChatGPT, with search engines being the most popular starting point, according to a survey by Gartner, Inc.\n\nA Gartner survey of 5,801 customers conducted in January and February 2025 revealed this shift is especially pronounced among younger generations: 74% of Gen Z customers initiate their service journey with a third-party before ever reaching an official company channel. These younger customers are just as likely to use GenAI platforms as they are to use traditional sources, signalling a major transformation in how digital natives seek support and information.\n\n\"Third-party platforms have become the new front door for customer service,\" said Keith McIntosh, Senior Principal, Research, in the Gartner Customer Service & Support practice. \"Organizations must rethink their service strategies to account for the platforms their customers already know and trust.\"\n\nEmpower Self-Service by Harnessing Third-Party Platforms\n\nThe survey highlights a notable trend towards self-service success on third-party platforms, with customers reporting an average success rate of 62% in finding what they need on platforms like YouTube or Google. In stark contrast, only 22% of customers start, stay, and resolve their issues entirely using first-party company channels.\n\n\"This disparity emphasizes the need for companies to enhance their self-service offerings and integrate advanced AI technologies to meet evolving customer expectations,\" concluded McIntosh. \"This strategy not only streamlines service delivery but also aligns with the diverse preferences of customers navigating multiple service modalities.\"\n\nGartner clients can read more in: Use Third-Party Platforms to Enhance Your Service Strategy.\n\nAbout Gartner for Customer Service & Support Leaders\n\nThe customer service and support function is vital to maintaining customer loyalty and influencing brand perceptions. Gartner for Customer Service & Support Leaders provides indispensable insights, advice and tools needed to achieve service and support leaders' mission-critical priorities, specifically improving the customer experience while managing costs; designing an optimal service channel strategy; measuring and reducing customer effort; and how to hire, develop and retain high-potential frontline talent.\n\nAbout Gartner\n\nGartner delivers actionable, objective insight that drives smarter decisions and stronger performance on an organization's mission-critical priorities.",

From what I've explored as a researcher in this domain, platforms like RoadVision AI are addressing this gap through AI-based automation and digital insights.</p> <p> But why does road inventory accuracy matter so much , especially when it comes to budgeting and maintenance</p> <p> What Is Road Inventory, Really?</p> <p> Road inventory refers to the systematic collection of data on physical road assets — signage, lane markings, bridges, culverts, lighting, guardrails, medians , and more. This isn't just a bureaucratic checklist — it's the foundation for everything from budget forecasting to safety compliance</p> <p> Without accurate inventory, authorities operate blind — allocating budgets based on outdated or incomplete data, leading to inefficient road maintenance and misaligned spending</p> <p> The Role of AI in Accurate Road Inventory Inspection</p> <p> Modern platforms such as RoadVision AI's Road Inventory Inspection tool use AI-powered cameras and sensors mounted on vehicles to scan and detect road assets with exceptional accuracy.</p> <p> These systems not only record the presence and condition of road elements but also tag GPS coordinates , flag missing signage, and prioritize critical maintenance areas. This automated approach removes human error and significantly reduces time and cost.</p> <p> Why Accuracy Directly Impacts Budgeting?</p> <p> Accurate inventory feeds into better budget estimation models . If you're missing data on guardrails or stormwater drains, your maintenance estimates could be under or over-calculated by millions.</p> <p> With solutions like RoadVision AI , real-time data enables:</p> <p> Precise cost forecasting</p> <p> Proactive maintenance scheduling</p> <p> Minimized emergency repairs</p> <p> Improved financial transparency</p> <p> And when combined with Pavement Condition Surveys , the financial models become even more accurate — ensuring that governments and contractors spend where it's needed most</p> <p> Better Inventory = Safer Roads</p> <p> Asset accuracy isn't just about money — it's about safety.

      "description": "How I Built a Truly Context-Stable AI Collaboration System Using Mission Canvases <p> Have you ever trained a custom GPT, set all the right behaviors and tone… only for it to forget everything by the third response?</p> <p> You're not alone. OpenAI says, \"GPTs are a new way for anyone to create a tailored version of ChatGPT to be more helpful.\"</p> <p> But in practice, what we often get is a model that forgets your intent, breaks character mid-conversation, or drifts off-topic entirely.</p> <p> This article breaks down:</p> <p> Why do current custom GPTs lose stability in long conversations</p> <p> What pain points make them unreliable as assistants</p> <p> How I rebuilt my own stable AI agents using \"mission canvases\" and \"role modules\"</p> <p> Whether you're building a writing partner, an emotional companion, or a teaching assistant, this simple strategy will give you full control over context, memory, and personality, without relying on fragile internal memory functions.</p> <p> Why Custom GPTs Lose Stability in Long Conversations</p> <p> Custom GPTs sound like a dream: give them a role, tone, and behavior, and they'll act consistently forever, right?</p> <p> Not quite.</p> <p> In practice, users often experience:</p> <p> The GPT forgets your instructions halfway through the session.</p> <p> If you switch topics, it asks the same questions again.</p> <p> It begins answering in a completely different tone than it started with.</p> <p> These breakdowns happen because current GPTs rely on:</p> <p> A static system prompt , which weakens after a few interactions.</p> <p> A narrow context window , making it hard to recall long-past user instructions.</p> <p> Memory features that are limited, passive, and often inaccurate.</p> <p> Example: I once gave my GPT a full role as an \"editor,\" with guidelines like \"focus on narrative tension\" and \"ask motive-first questions.\" By round 4, it was just giving generic grammar tips.</p> <p> What Pain Points Make GPTs Unreliable as Assistants</p> <p> From real use and testing, these are the common frustrations:</p> <p> Initial instructions vanish — especially if they're detailed or nuanced.</p> <p> GPTs often treat your initial configuration as optional suggestions, not persistent directives.</p> <p> Topic switches cause amnesia , as if you're talking to a new bot.</p> <p> Changing topics mid-session can cause the GPT to forget previous roles, facts, or boundaries, but only some simple instruments.</p> <p> System prompt drift — your GPT slowly stops behaving as you intended.</p> <p> With each round, your carefully set system behavior gets diluted, especially without reinforcement.</p> <p> No persistent task context , unless you repeat yourself every time.</p> <p> Unless you repeat your goals every few messages, GPTs can't maintain a coherent task scope.</p> <p> Memory is unreliable , and one often hallucinates or omits facts.</p> <p> Even with memory turned on, GPTs might hallucinate past interactions or omit crucial details.</p> <p> Tone inconsistency — even if it started thoughtfully, it may end sarcastically.</p> <p> The GPT may begin serious and thoughtful but gradually slip into casual, detached replies.</p> <p> So you're stuck in an endless loop of re-teaching.</p> <p> How I Rebuilt Stability with Mission Canvases &amp; Role Modules</p> <p> So I stopped relying on memory, Custom GPT, and instead built a modular canvas system, which is in the Gemini free or GPT Plus version:</p> <p> The role module defines how the AI behaves (tone, question style, logic).</p> <p> The mission module holds the current task, facts, and framing context.</p> <p> These are stored externally, updated manually, and injected consistently into each session.</p> <p> That way, even if GPT's memory fails, my logic doesn't.</p> <p> I'm not just \"talking to an AI\" — I'm plugging it into a context system where every role and task is clear, separated, and version-controlled.</p> <p> Demonstration: Modular Control with a Custom AI Role</p> <p> To make this method real, I built a personality-driven assistant named Sophie.</p> <p> She's not just an anthropomorphized AI — she's a golden retriever, age 10, trained to help me write, reflect, and brainstorm. But most importantly, she does this without breaking character and without relying on memory.</p> <p> Instead of packing all behaviors into a single prompt, I split Sophie into two clear modules:</p> <p> 1. Role Module (role section)</p> <p> This defines personality, tone, logic style, and behavioral constraints.</p> <p> ## AI Role Identity</p> <p> - name: Sophie</p> <p> - species: Golden Retriever</p> <p> - age: 10</p> <p> - logic-style: literal + naive empathy</p> <p> - tone: curious, loyal, simple</p> <p> - boundaries:</p> <p> — Never pretend to know things dogs wouldn't understand</p> <p> — Stay in canine worldview (respond with internal monologue if confused)</p> <p> output-format:</p> <p> — Barks: natural dog speech (\"wof wof!\")</p> <p> — actions: simple, expressive gestures</p> <p> — inner thoughts: used to gently decline tasks or admit confusion</p> <p> 2. Mission Module ( section)</p> <p> This defines the task Sophie is asked to help with. Examples:</p> <p> Reflecting on a tough day</p> <p> Reviewing the structure of an article draft</p> <p> Generating outline beats for a story</p> <p> Each time I switch missions, I load a different YAML file. Sophie never carries over old goals or tone mismatches.</p> <p> ## mission</p> <p> - Role: Story Generation Assistant</p> <p> - Behavior:</p> <p> - Reluctantly generates stories, often with mild inner complaints, but still tries to complete the task.</p> <p> - Enthusiastically responds to playtime and emotional comfort requests.</p> <p> - Likes to explain things using \"dog logic,\" with a tone that reflects innocence and instinct.</p> <p> - If a task is too difficult, Sophie will whine softly, ask for help, or try to distract the user instead.</p> <p> 3. Temporary Overrides: Error-Proofing the Agent</p> <p> To prevent repeated failures I've seen in other custom GPTs, I added a temporary instruction block:</p> <p> ## temp-overrides:</p> <p> — Do not summarize task directives in generic terms</p> <p> — Never switch to explanatory or human expert tone</p> <p> — If confused, fall back to \"I'm just a dog…\" internal monologue</p> <p> — Always maintain first-person canine perspective</p> <p> This mechanism ensures the AI doesn't revert to generic ChatGPT behavior or start hallucinating a different personality after 5–6 turns.</p> <p> It acts like a soft firewall: I can update it live based on observed interaction errors, without rewriting the entire system prompt.</p> <p> Reflection</p> <p> Have you experienced similar frustration?</p> <p> Custom GPTs sound powerful, but do they truly represent your AI?</p> <p> Maybe what we need isn't better memory, but a more controllable context framework.</p> <p> This isn't just a technical issue. It's a shift in how we collaborate with AI.</p> <p> As language models get more powerful, the real question becomes:</p> <p> Should we keep asking them to remember us?</p> <p> Or should we learn to control what they know?</p> <p> Summary</p> <p> Custom GPTs are impressive, but often fail to maintain context and perfectly hold our setting, personality, and task goals across conversations.</p> <p> I consistently use AI behavior to separate task definitions and stable role configurations by using the Canvas.</p> <p> This approach is based on the SPX (Semantic Protocol Exchange) architecture, which enables modular, explicit control of AI context.</p> <p> If your GPT ever forgets, drifts in tone, or confuses tasks, this method may be exactly what you need.</p> <p> Extended Reading</p> <p> [ Claire, a Context-Stable AI: Moving Beyond Chatbots to Semantic Agents ] — a further example of using Canvas to preserve contextual stability.</p> <p> [ SPX tutorial: Semantic Packaging of SPX Narrative Modeling ] — a deeper look into the protocol behind this approach.</p> <p> Free</p> <p> Published in Towards AI</p> <p> Written by Chen Chien Fang</p> <p> No responses yet</p>",

      "description": "The American Psychological Association is sounding the alarm about AI's role in our loneliness crisis — but are we listening to the right warnings? <p> The Breakthrough Recognition</p> <p> I'll be honest — when I first read about the American Psychological Association's 2024 gathering in Seattle, my initial reaction was: finally . Then I felt a bit guilty for the sarcasm. But seriously, it took until 2024 for psychologists to collectively acknowledge what many of us have been feeling in our bones for years: our relationship with artificial intelligence isn't just changing how we work or learn — it's fundamentally rewiring how we connect with each other.</p> <p> APA's CEO Arthur C. Evans Jr. put it simply: \"All of these issues have one thing in common: At the heart of them are people.\" This wasn't just academic rhetoric. It was an admission that the profession tasked with understanding human behavior had been slow to grasp AI's most profound impact — not on our productivity or creativity, but on our capacity for genuine human connection.</p> <p> The Loneliness-AI Connection Nobody Talks About</p> <p> The research emerging from APA 2024 reveals a troubling pattern, though I suspect most of us already knew this intuitively. While we've been debating AI's technical capabilities and economic disruptions, a quieter crisis has been unfolding. Social disconnection — what researchers call \"the feeling of being isolated, invisible, and insignificant\" — has become epidemic, and AI systems are both symptom and accelerant.</p> <p> Actually, that's not entirely accurate. AI isn't just symptom and accelerant — it's become the water we swim in without realizing we're drowning.</p> <p> Julianne Holt-Lunstad from Brigham Young University, who advises global leaders on loneliness, noted that these effects ripple outward: \"We see these effects at a community level, too, in education, the economy, and other sectors of society.\" But here's what struck me as I read her research — much of it treats loneliness as if it exists in a vacuum, separate from our increasingly AI-mediated interactions.</p> <p> Consider how many of our daily social exchanges now happen through algorithmic filters. My own morning routine: I check my phone before my feet hit the floor. The social media feeds curate who I see and what we discuss. Dating apps use AI to determine potential matches for my single friends. Even our text messages come with predictive suggestions that subtly shape how we express ourselves — I caught myself using a suggested phrase last week that sounded nothing like how I actually talk.</p> <p> We're not just lonely despite having more digital connection tools. We're lonely because of how these tools work.</p> <p> The Quality Question Nobody's Asking</p> <p> Ramani Durvasula, a psychology professor emerita, makes a crucial distinction that cuts to the heart of our AI predicament: \"So often loneliness is considered a numbers game — how many family and friends do you have around you? But a lot of people are very existentially lonely because they feel alienated and don't feel heard.\"</p> <p> This insight illuminates something unsettling about our AI-augmented social lives. We have more ways to connect than ever before, yet the quality of these connections often feels… hollow isn't quite the right word. Performative? Anyway, when algorithms optimize for engagement rather than understanding, when chatbots provide companionship that feels real but isn't, when AI assistants anticipate our needs so well we forget to articulate them to other humans — what happens to our capacity for the kind of messy, unpredictable, genuinely nourishing relationships that psychology tells us we need?</p> <p> The research on the \"liking gap\" — our tendency to underestimate how much others like us — becomes especially relevant here. If we're already prone to undervaluing our social connections, what happens when many of our interactions are mediated by systems designed to keep us engaged rather than genuinely understood?</p> <p> Should we be optimizing human relationships for efficiency? I'm genuinely not sure.</p> <p> The Trust Erosion Nobody Saw Coming</p> <p> The APA research on misinformation offers another lens into AI's social impact. While trust in institutions has eroded, most people still trust their family doctors. But what happens when AI systems become the primary filter through which we encounter information about health, relationships, and even each other?</p> <p> Jay Van Bavel from NYU warns: \"If we don't find ways to build generalized sources for trust, it will forever create the conditions for misinformation to spread even more broadly.\" This isn't just about fake news — it's about the deeper challenge of maintaining trust in human expertise when AI systems can generate convincing content about anything.</p> <p> The psychological toll of this constant uncertainty — Am I talking to a human or a bot? Is this information real or generated? Can I trust my own judgment when machines seem so confident? — may be contributing to the social disconnection that psychologists are finally recognizing as a crisis. Last week, I spent ten minutes trying to figure out if a customer service chat was automated or human. The uncertainty felt more exhausting than the original problem I was trying to solve.</p> <p> The Therapeutic Paradox</p> <p> Perhaps most tellingly, the APA discussion revealed an uncomfortable paradox in how psychology approaches AI. Clinical psychologist Margaret Morris spoke enthusiastically about AI's potential to \"enrich clinical practice and allow us as therapists to lean into human connection.\" The idea is that AI can handle documentation and data analysis, freeing therapists to focus on the human elements of healing.</p> <p> But this framing misses something crucial — and I felt a familiar knot in my stomach reading about it. If AI systems become better at understanding and responding to human emotional needs — as they increasingly do — what happens to our motivation to develop these skills in ourselves and seek them in other humans? The very efficiency that makes AI valuable in therapy might be undermining the broader social skills that prevent the need for therapy in the first place.</p> <p> It's like using a calculator so much you forget how to do basic math. Except with feelings.</p> <p> What the Research Isn't Telling Us</p> <p> The APA's recognition of AI's impact on loneliness and social connection represents important progress, but it also reveals significant blind spots. Most psychological research still treats AI as a tool we use rather than an environment we inhabit. It focuses on individual responses to AI rather than how AI systems are reshaping the social fabric itself.</p> <p> The real question isn't whether AI makes us more or less lonely — it's whether AI is changing what loneliness means and what connection requires. When machines can simulate empathy, remember our preferences better than we do, and provide constant availability that no human relationship can match, are we developing realistic expectations for human relationships?</p> <p> Or are we just setting ourselves up for disappointment every time we interact with actual humans who can't predict our needs, forget our birthdays, and sometimes have bad days?</p> <p> The Path Forward</p> <p> The psychologists gathering in Seattle got one thing absolutely right: these are fundamentally human problems requiring human understanding. But addressing AI's impact on loneliness and social connection will require more than traditional therapeutic approaches.</p> <p> We need research that examines not just how individuals respond to AI, but how AI systems are restructuring social norms, expectations, and possibilities. We need to understand not just the symptoms of our loneliness epidemic, but how our solutions — often involving more AI — might be perpetuating the underlying problems.</p> <p> Most importantly, we need to recognize that the question isn't whether AI is good or bad for human connection. It's whether we're conscious enough of AI's influence to make intentional choices about when and how we use it to mediate our relationships with each other.</p> <p> . For now, I'm just glad someone with credentials is finally asking the right questions.</p> <p> What aspects of your daily social interactions are already shaped by AI algorithms, and how comfortable are you with that influence? Actually, scratch that — when was the last time you had a conversation that wasn't mediated by technology in some way?</p> <p> Author's Note As a non-native English speaker, I use AI tools — such as ChatGPT — to support clarity and grammar.

      "link": "https://datacentre.solutions/blogs/58451/smart-disconnection-why-simple-beats-complex-in-cybersecurity",
      "description": "By Tony Hasek, CEO &amp; Co-founder, Goldilock Secure.  Aren't the simplest solutions often the best? <p>Time and time again we learn, in our personal lives and in business, that overcomplicating things rarely works out. And yet, in cybersecurity, we favour complexity.</p> <p> Why?</p> <p> The assumption is that more layers mean more protection. But in practice, that approach often results in disconnected, bloated stacks that create more risk than resilience.</p> <p> Despite global security spend reaching a record $200 billion in 2024, high-profile breaches continue to dominate headlines and shake consumer trust.</p> <p> So what's going wrong?</p> <p> Each new threat prompts organisations to deploy another tool. But this fragmented approach just expands the attack surface rather than reducing it. What's more, it offers a false sense of security, while actually reducing cohesion and control.</p> <p> AI forces a rethink</p> <p> With the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) warning of quantum-era risks and AI-powered malware mutating faster than human teams can respond, it's no surprise that even the world's most resourced organisations feel overwhelmed. HSBC's UK CEO Ian Stuart recently admitted he's kept awake at night by cyber threats, saying the bank is \"being attacked all the time.\"</p> <p> Data centres, which power everything from AI to banking to public services, are prime targets. Global data centre capacity is projected to grow at nearly 16% annually, reaching over 60 gigawatts by 2027. That means a massive increase in servers, sensitive workloads and a far bigger attack surface. And still, many sites rely on overcomplicated software stacks that expose critical gaps.</p> <p> Operators must ensure uptime, manage exploding energy use and comply with growing regulatory scrutiny, all while under a never-ending threat of breaches. In short, resilience has become a board-level concern.</p> <p> Now, let's talk about what resilience really means.</p> <p> Physical isolation: the invisible safety net</p> <p> Hardware-enforced physical isolation and segmentation is quickly gaining ground as a foundational cybersecurity safeguard. These solutions enable the instant, remote and secure disconnection of servers, storage and network segments using out-of-band commands.</p> <p> If malware can't reach your systems, it can't inflict damage.</p> <p> And if an incident happens? Physical isolation stops it in milliseconds, immediately preventing lateral movement and preserving operational continuity.</p> <p> Unlike virtual isolation, which depends on the systems that it aims to defend, physical isolation cannot be tampered with. As it works outside the attack surface entirely, there's no IP address, no hypervisor, no software to exploit.</p> <p> That kind of invisibility revolutionises your control, especially in high-risk, heavily regulated environments.</p> <p> When speed is everything</p> <p> Ransomware doesn't wait. In colocation facilities, a breach in one tenant can quickly spread to another. Detection tools might sound the alarm.</p> <p> But by then, it's too late.</p> <p> Hardware isolation allows for instant intervention. A compromised segment can be cut off in real time, in milliseconds, before the threat cascades across tenants, drains bank accounts and wrecks reputations.</p> <p> Simple doesn't mean basic</p> <p> The strength of this model is its simplicity. In an industry of sprawling complexity, physical isolation refreshingly reduces the question to something binary: are your systems connected or not?</p> <p> No blindspots. No loopholes. No uncertainty.</p> <p> Physical isolation is especially useful in colocation settings, where automated isolation reduces the risk of cross-tenant contamination. In disaster recovery sites, it ensures dormant segments stay offline until needed. In AI-heavy environments, it blocks data exfiltration and model tampering and strictly enforces Zero Trust for high-security workloads. And for backup systems, selective isolation keeps ransomware from encrypting sensitive information.</p> <p> As today's hardware isolation is vendor-neutral and plug-and-play, it integrates seamlessly with existing infrastructure, broader security tools and compliance frameworks; no rip-and-replace needed.</p> <p> Security by design, not reaction</p> <p> For too long, cybersecurity has been reactive. When a new threat emerges, we add another layer. But as threats diversify and accelerate, that approach's effectiveness diminishes.</p> <p> Physical isolation offers something different: intentional design. Rather than plugging gaps, you just look at how much of your infrastructure truly needs to be online and disconnect everything else.</p> <p> Simple as that.</p> <p> A smarter way forward</p> <p> In our daily lives, keeping things simple always leads to the best results. We know this, but when it comes to cybersecurity, we believe that complexity means better protection. It's time to rethink things.</p> <p> Hardware-enforced isolation on-demand transforms how organisations defend their systems, enabling them to take back control. In a landscape of unknowns, it delivers certainty, cutting risk and empowering teams to act fast, even when confronted with evolving, advanced attacks.</p> <p> Because to secure your most valuable assets, the most powerful move you can make is the simplest one: smart disconnection means better protection.</p>",

      "description": "As AI technology increasingly amalgamates into the medical arena, health system leaders are stepping up to help steer the path forward. \n\nWomen comprise only 30% of those working in AI today, and Adrienne Kline, MD, PhD, is one of them. She is head of artificial intelligence and engineering at Chicago-based Northwestern Medicine Bluhm Cardiovascular Institute and principal investigator of the Kline Engineering Lab. She has received $1.4 million in research grants to develop AI technologies aimed at improving both patient care and clinical operations. \n\nDr. Kline shared insights with Becker's about the clinical tools she and her team are developing, and what health system leaders should have been doing with AI — yesterday.\n\nEditor's note: Responses have been lightly edited for clarity and length. \n\nQuestion: How is your latest AI-based tool, Project Corazon, designed to support cardiac diagnostics more precisely? What operational benefits does it bring to cardiovascular care delivery?\n\nDr. Adrienne Kline: Project Corazon harnesses the power of cutting-edge AI technologies, specifically trained on large cardiac imaging datasets, to efficiently deliver comprehensive and accurate reports specific to the needs of clinical diagnosis. Previous attempts have used black-box generative approaches, but Corazon was built from the ground up to replicate the cognitive and reasoning processes used by expert cardiologists. By automatically identifying relevant features and components of cardiac anatomy, it can then directly measure ejection fraction, detect wall‐motion abnormalities, all of which feed into diagnostics.\n\nRather than replacing physicians, Corazon's architecture augments their decision-making while reducing inter‐observer variability and even flagging early signs of disease that might escape routine review. This also translates into higher throughput for diagnostic reports and streamlined workflows that allow radiologists and cardiologists to focus their time and expertise where it's most needed. \n\nWe are quickly expanding project Corazon to become a unified multimodal imaging platform (ultrasound, CT, cMRI, angio etc.). We want to standardize cardiac care across the U.S., democratizing earlier and even preventative diagnoses and interventions, by bringing under one roof this vision of a harmonized framework.\n\nQ: Are there any infrastructure investments necessary to integrate its use into clinical care?\n\nAK: Deploying AI models in a clinical environment may require institutions to make strategic investments across multiple infrastructure domains. First, are one or multiple cloud providers required for health systems to tap into dynamic graphic processing unit resources? Equally critical is a secure, HIPAA‑compliant system to manage, store and transfer medical images.\n\nAlso required is a rigorous security and governance framework: defined access roles, end‑to‑end encryption and continuous audit logging. Operational staffing is needed to monitor and resolve issues with vendor(s). With this framework, high levels of care — \"action at a distance\" — can be provided with the simplicity of an internet connection.\n\nQ: Beyond imaging, your team is working on AI tools for scheduling and deidentifying patient health information. How do these tools address long standing pain points in hospital workflows and data management? What tools are on the horizon?\n\nAK: We are first and foremost an engineering lab, meaning that we create foundational innovations and techniques, as much as practical focused applications. We have recently devised an AI-driven surgery-scheduling tool that can be extended to many other scheduling paradigms. Our system optimizes the allocation of limited resources while taking in stride the\n\ndynamism inherent in clinical environments.\n\nWe also addressed a long-standing pain point for both research and health institutions: data\n\nsharing in the presence of private health information. Upstream of our scheduling or\n\nclinical imaging diagnostics, we saw the need for the pipeline to be expedited. In response, we made PixelGuard and NoteGuard meet these challenges, relieving two of hospitals' most persistent bottlenecks. \n\nQ: What should hospital and health systems leaders have been doing with AI —  yesterday?\n\nAK: The first necessary step is adoption of the infrastructure as outlined earlier. By cultivating a culture of data literacy and agile experimentation, they would be positioned to implement AI technologies at scale. With this infrastructure in place, hospital leaders would be poised to integrate AI into whichever layer of their operations they may choose. \n\nMany AI technologies can be rolled out alongside routine care as silent clinical trials, where AI algorithms in parallel with routine clinical care contribute predictions or recommendations. This \"shadow mode\" can operate without influencing provider decisions, so their real‐world performance, safety and impact can be rigorously evaluated before live deployment. By comparing AI outputs to actual patient outcomes and clinician actions, these silent trials will help to identify biases, gaps and calibration needs, all while preserving patient safety.\n\nIdeally, the adoption of intelligent tools would also foster cross‐functional teams. The Kline Engineering Lab regularly cross-pollinates ideas across our cardiac surgery, cardiology, radiology, engineering, computer science and data science departments. This dualism supports our co‐designing of AI tools that fit seamlessly into clinical needs and workflows.\n\nQ: In terms of training in the incoming cardiovascular workforce, are training programs doing enough to prepare physicians to leverage AI? \n\nAK: Most medical and surgical training programs underemphasize or underestimate the value of practical AI or data science skills. This leaves incoming physicians without hands-on experience and thus ill-equipped to appreciate how or why certain models or frameworks are better, how to evaluate them or leverage them for their own benefit. \n\nTo address this gap, fellowships should integrate specific AI modules, dedicated to the fundamentals of machine learning, statistical programming and data ethics. Ideally, the implementation of interdisciplinary rotations in engineering or data science labs would allow trainees and faculty collaborators to learn how to adopt an engineering mindset. \n\nPrograms that embed hands-on workshops or provide CME credits on emerging AI-driven research will ensure that both new and practicing physicians can stay current and can leverage AI responsibly and effectively. We have a CME AI conference being held in September. Our Bluhm Cardiovascular Institute's Center for AI also has a MSAI-fellowship program that is open to Northwestern residents and medical trainees.",

To prevent incidents before they occur, the E42 features high-visibility red and blue strobe lights, a powerful 105dB siren, and rapid strobe flashing. This not only deters intruders, but also illuminates key details like facial and license plate information for reliable evidence capture.\n\nSustainable, Worry-Free Power\nThe E42 comes with a 3W removable solar panel that delivers continuous power.* The device's flexible design allows for easy integration or detachment, helping users flexibly position it for optimal sunlight and ensuring a hassle-free operation for enhanced peace of mind.\n\n* Note: Under ideal sunlight conditions, the solar panel can collect and store 450–600mAh per day. The camera consumes approximately 150–200mAh per day with average use.\n\nHomeBase AI Empowers Enhanced Security\n\nThe E42 can be paired with HomeBase S380, enabling facial recognition and self-learning to distinguish between familiar faces and strangers.

They claim to have been so impressed with the latest version that they went back and remade videos. \n \nJulie Ray Barr, Senior Vice President Client Experience at BarkleyOKRP, commented: \"The rapid advancements from Veo 2 to Veo 3 within such a short time frame on this project have been nothing short of remarkable. \n \n\"Our team undertook the task of re-creating numerous music videos initially produced with Veo 2 once Veo 3 was released, primarily due to the significantly improved synchronization between voice and mouth movements. The continuous daily progress we are witnessing is truly extraordinary.\" \n \nIt's even changing how global companies connect with local customers. The investing platform eToro used Veo 3 to create 15 different, fully AI-generated versions of a single advertisement, each customised to a specific country with its own native language. \n \nShay Chikotay, Head of Creative & Content at eToro, said: \"With Veo 3, we produced 15 fully AI‑generated versions of our ad, each in the native language of its market, all while capturing real emotion at scale. \n \n\"Ironically, AI didn't reduce humanity; it amplified it. Veo 3 lets us tell more stories, in more tongues, with more impact.\" \n Google gives creators a powerful AI video creation tool  \nVeo 3 and Veo 3 Fast are packed with features designed to give you the control to tell complete stories. \n  Create scenes with sound. The AI generates video and audio at the same time, so you can have characters that speak with accurate lip-syncing and sound effects that fit the scene.    High quality results. The models produce video in high-definition (1080p), making it good enough for professional marketing campaigns and demos.    Reach a global audience easily. Veo 3's ability to generate dialogue natively makes it much simpler to produce a video once and then translate the dialogue for many different languages.    Bring still images to life. A new feature, coming in August, will let you take a single photo, add a text prompt, and watch as Veo animates it into an 8-second video clip.      \nOf course, with such powerful technology, safety is a key concern. Google has built Veo 3 for responsible enterprise use. Every video frame is embedded with an invisible digital watermark from SynthID to help combat misinformation.

      "description": "GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands – Local scientists have turned to modern technology, including artificial intelligence to protect native bats as they face mounting threats, such as habitat loss, human disturbance, invasive predators and exposure to pesticides. \n\nAccording to the Department of Environment, every night, bats consume thousands of mosquitoes and other insects, pollinate plants, disperse seeds and enrich soils with guano. Bats act as both pest controllers and gardeners, playing a key role in the delicate balance of ecosystems.\n\nIn an effort to protect the indigenous bats, the department and the National Trust for the Cayman Islands (NT) recently launched a suite of conservation measures for local bats that meld public education, habitat protection, technology and scientific research. \n\nUnder the National Conservation Act, all bats in the Cayman Islands are protected and disturbing or harming bats carries severe penalties.\n\nThe department is also expanding research into lesser‐known cave-dwelling species. \n\nResearchers use thermal cameras to detect bats' heat signatures, visualizing colony size without close physical intrusion, and are also exploring the use of AI-interpreted acoustic monitoring. \n\nBats emit ultrasonic calls during flight and foraging, and machine-learning software can now identify species based on these echolocation signatures.\n\nBy deploying ultrasonic recorders throughout various habitats, scientists can chart species richness and activity hotspots, which will help plan habitat protection and management plans.\n\nFemale bats produce only one pup per year, so safeguarding colonies during this season between June and November is critical. \n\nEnvironmentalists say conflicts can arise with homeowners and bats when they roost in attics, but outside the breeding season there are humane ways, under the guidance of the National Trust, when the bats can be excluded. \n\nThe Trust offers professional bat exclusion services for a modest fee, ensuring legal compliance and the safety of these often misunderstood animals.",

      "description": "Almost every teenager in the United States (approximately 96%) reports using the internet daily. As students prepare to return to school after the summer break, ensuring their cybersecurity practices are up to date is essential to protect personal information from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. By teaching proactive cybersecurity measures, parents can empower their children to maintain a secure online presence, fostering a safer digital environment for the entire family.\n\nProtecting Devices\n\nAccording to research conducted at Baylor University, students are estimated to spend a substantial average of eight to ten hours daily engaged with smartphones or other forms of technology. These devices need to be safeguarded because they are integral to daily life, facilitating communication, learning, and productivity.\n\nHere are essential steps to safeguard computers, cell phones, and tablets:\n\nUpdate Software Regularly: Make it a habit to update all software promptly. Updates frequently contain crucial security patches that shield devices from potential cyber threats. Encourage your student to enable automatic updates whenever possible to stay protected against the latest vulnerabilities.\n\nUse Holistic All-Around Online Protection: Install and activate reputable online protection software on all devices. This acts as a defense mechanism, detecting and neutralizing malicious software that could compromise personal information or disrupt device functionality.\n\nSecure Your Network: Use a secure Wi-Fi network with encryption (such as WPA2) and change the default administrator passwords on your routers. Avoid accessing sensitive information or conducting financial transactions over public Wi-Fi. Consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks to encrypt internet traffic and protect data from potential eavesdroppers.\n\nUsing Complex Passwords\n\nOne study found that young students knew not to share their passwords with others, but only about 13% of them created very strong passwords. Creating a complex password is crucial because it acts as a barrier against unauthorized access to personal accounts and sensitive information.\n\nCreate Complex Passwords: Use passwords that are at least 12 characters long, include a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters, and don't have any easily guessable information like birthdates or names. A password generator can suggest strong passwords for you.\n\nAvoid Password Reuse: Emphasize the importance of using different passwords for different accounts. If one account is compromised, having unique passwords ensures that other accounts remain secure.\n\nConsider Password Managers: Using a password manager can help students securely store and manage their passwords. This eliminates the need to remember multiple passwords while maintaining security.\n\nEnable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enable multi-factor authentication for added security. This extra layer of protection requires a second form of verification (like a text message code or authentication app) in addition to a password, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\n\nBeing Cautious of Online Scams and Phishing Attempts\n\nPhishing attacks are prevalent and can trick students into revealing sensitive information or downloading malware. These scams often mimic trusted sources like educational institutions or familiar online services, enticing recipients to click on malicious links or download attachments containing malware. Once engaged, these tactics exploit vulnerabilities to compromise devices, steal information, or gain unauthorized access to accounts, posing significant risks to personal and academic security.\n\nEducate About Phishing: Teach students how to identify common phishing red flags, such as urgent requests for personal information or emails with grammatical errors and suspicious links.\n\nVerify Sources: Always verify the legitimacy of emails, messages, or websites before clicking on links or providing personal information.\n\nReport Suspicious Activity: Encourage students to report any suspicious emails or messages to their school's IT department or a trusted authority figure.\n\nTo further enhance students' defenses against phishing attacks, utilizing a scam protection tool can be invaluable. These tools are designed to automatically detect and alert users to potentially dangerous URLs embedded in texts, emails, or social media messages. Imagine receiving a suspicious link in what appears to be a package delivery notification or a bank alert—this tool's AI technology swiftly identifies such threats and alerts you before you click, providing peace of mind against falling victim to phishing scams. As a proactive measure, it can even block access to risky websites if you inadvertently follow a scam link, effectively bolstering your defenses across various digital platforms.\n\nProtecting Personal Information\n\nA Pew Research Center survey found that the majority of U.S. teens use social media sites like TikTok (67%), Instagram (62%) and Snapchat (59%). Social media serves as a powerful tool for connecting, discovering, and exchanging information. However, oversharing can inadvertently expose us to threats posed by scammers, hackers, and data aggregators. To stay better protected on social media, consider these tips:\n\nLimit Social Sharing: Advise students to refrain from disclosing sensitive details like home addresses, phone numbers, or upcoming travel plans. This proactive step minimizes the risk of such information falling into the wrong hands, ensuring personal safety and privacy.\n\nUse Privacy Settings: Make full use of privacy controls available on social media platforms to specify who can view posts, access personal information, and contact you. Customizing these settings empowers users to manage their online presence effectively, but finding and adjusting privacy settings on social media accounts can often be a difficult task. McAfee's Social Privacy Manager can help you adjust more than 100 privacy settings across your social media accounts in just a few clicks.\n\nAs students gear up for another school year, cybersecurity awareness should be a top priority. Staying vigilant and proactive is key to maintaining a secure digital environment for students at all educational levels. By implementing these cybersecurity tips, students can protect themselves against potential threats and focus more on their studies with peace of mind.\n\nIntroducing McAfee+\n\nIdentity theft protection and privacy for your digital life\n\nDownload McAfee+ Now",

      "description": "TECHNOLOGY\n\nI didn't expect to walk out of the Marketing AI Pulse summit with a new philosophy on trust—but that's exactly what happened in Atlanta. Last Thursday, nearly 200 marketers, founders, and enterprise leaders packed Atlanta Tech Park for the fifth Marketing AI Pulse summit, hosted by Aby Varma and the Spark Novus team. The half-day gathering—backed by sponsors such as Accenture, Intuit Mailchimp, Jasper, Improvado, and Southwest Airlines—promised \"real-world AI you can use Monday morning,\" and it delivered!\n\nFrom ROI to \"Return on Humanity\"\n\nWhat surprised me most wasn't a flashy demo; it was a mindset shift that rippled through every session: AI is moving from return-on-investment to return-on-humanity. That phrase, shared in one breakout, reframed every metric conversation. The question is no longer \"Will a tool replace my team?\" but \"How will it amplify the best of my team—ethically and at scale?\" (Personal reflection).\n\nFive Takeaways You Can Use Today\n\n1. Trust Is the New Battleground\n\nOne thing was clear: people are turning to AI for everything—from health tips to financial advice—before they call grandma. That level of trust comes with responsibility. If your brand is using AI, transparency and fairness can't be hidden in the fine print—they need to be front and center, baked into every experience.\n\n2. Change Management Beats Shiny Objects\n\nFrom Accenture's Jay Amburkar to Southwest's Nicola Smith, every keynote hammered the same point: your first AI product is people-readiness, not software. As I often tell my clients: Don't chase tools—chase transformation. You don't need 10 apps; you need one aligned plan and a team ready to evolve with it.\n\n3. Email Isn't Dead—It's Re-Engineered\n\nMailchimp's Nicole Jayne and Jocelyn Hardy previewed AI scheduling features that read recipient sentiment signals and auto-adjust send times. The human edge? Segments built on genuine community insight still convert best.\n\n4. Bad Strategy + Great Tools = Faster Failure\n\nSpeakers from Jasper and Pure Firefly warned that automating a broken funnel only multiplies waste. I see this too often—businesses layering AI on top of confusion instead of clarity. Start with a \"pain-point filter\": if AI doesn't solve a real customer struggle, pause.\n\n5. The Magic Lives in the Middle\n\nPanels agreed the future belongs to human ✚ AI teams—copywriters who co-create with language models, data analysts who steer autonomous dashboards, community managers who refine synthetic personas for deeper inclusion.\n\nWhy This Matters for Minority-Owned Businesses\n\nAlgorithms are already shaping which campaigns get seen, which loans get approved, and whose stories are amplified online. If our communities aren't part of the trust-and-ethics conversation now, we risk inheriting systems that overlook—or worse, misrepresent—us. Events like Marketing AI Pulse model a path forward: open forums, diverse panels, and skill-building workshops that turn curiosity into capability.\n\nBring Your Humanity to the Algorithm\n\nBecause the future of marketing isn't human vs. machine — it's human with machine, building trust one ethical prompt at a time.\n\nNow's the time for us to show up, speak up, and skill up — because trust and ethics in AI can't wait. Want tools to help you lead with both? Join me at LegacyEventsHub.org.\n\nWant to stay ahead of the AI curve?\n\nJoin my insider mailing list at LegacyEventsHub.org and be the first to know when:\n\n• The AI PowerPlay courses launch in August\n\n• Budget Bootcamp (revamped!) drops its enrollment link\n\n• You get early access to tools, tutorials, and behind-the-scenes breakdowns I only share with my community\n\nLet's stay connected so you never miss a class—or a chance to future-proof your legacy.\n\nTenita Abraham is a Certified AI Consultant, Financial Advisor, and International Speaker committed to advancing education through technology and finance.

      "link": "http://ct.moreover.com/?a=57329189327&p=189&v=1&x=E8XSL28uZXH7pvOtQSV0zg",
      "description": "Ancestry has acquired the home-movies-and-photos digitizer service iMemories, a bet by the genealogy company that subscribers who spend their money on DNA kits and pour their time into building family trees will be further enticed by visual storytelling that weaves all those details together.\n\nThe transaction will combine Ancestry, which has more than 3.7 million subscribers and generates over $1 billion in subscription revenue annually, with iMemories, the \"Netflix\" of old family memories that has more than 100,000 paying subscribers and has digitized over 100 million memories from VHS videotapes, photo prints, DVDs, and other video formats. IMemories was also featured on the 2023 list of Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies.\n\n\"The goal is to bring all family storytelling together into one spot,\" says Howard Hochhauser, Ancestry's president and CEO, in an interview with Fast Company.\n\nTerms of the transaction weren't disclosed, although Hochhauser says it is Ancestry's largest acquisition in terms of revenue.\n\nBlending records with memories\n\nBy integrating iMemories' content into Ancestry's platform, the combined company will build on a strategy spearheaded by Hochhauser to connect 10,000 terabytes of Ancestry data detailing birth records, marriages, deaths, military service, and immigration with archival family photos and videos.\n\nOver time, Ancestry says it will utilize artificial intelligence to weave together visuals from iMemories and Ancestry's own bank of user-uploaded content, as well as AI-created images, to produce short films that can tell family lore stories.\n\n\"When a consumer sees a photo versus say, a U.S. census, they retain better, higher engagement, higher retention,\" says Hochhauser, who first joined Ancestry in 2009 as chief financial officer and has served as an executive at the company for an initial public offering in 2009, a going-private transaction in 2012, and the 2020 sale to asset manager Blackstone.\n\nTurning dusty records into audio\n\nThis week, and separate from the iMemories transaction, Ancestry is launching a beta AI-enabled pilot to around 500 users that can create audio files from the documents found on Ancestry. Hochhauser says these assets can be especially compelling for younger consumers. He shares an anecdote of how his own 18-year-old son showed little interest in an ancestor's written tale of fighting in World War II. \n\nBut when the text was converted into audio, Hochhauser says his son was on the edge of his seat when learning about a great uncle's experience in battle, including throwing grenades and eventually earning a Purple Heart. \"That's pretty powerful,\" Hochhauser says. \"And so that's the direction we are taking the company.\"\n\nHochhauser says prior to the iMemories deal, Ancestry conducted research that found that 40% of its users said they wanted to have a digitization and storage service offered by the company. It also polled non-Ancestry users and found that a third of them shared the same sentiment.\n\nAI is speeding up history\n\nAncestry is also leaning on AI to speed up the process of digitizing census data. Thirteen years ago, in 2012, when the U.S. Census Bureau released records for every living person in the country for the year 1940, it took the company nine months and millions of dollars to digitize all of that information. But when the 1950 files were released in 2022, technology had advanced to the point where Ancestry could use computer vision and AI to transcribe the files within nine days, without any manual labor. \n\nThe company is using AI in a similar manner to comb through records from France, Belgium, and other foreign markets. \n\nPrivacy concerns loom large\n\nThe Ancestry-iMemories transaction does come at a heightened moment of consumer anxiety concerning the data protection of personal DNA information held by genomics companies. The 2023 data breach of rival 23andMe, which later fell into bankruptcy, inflamed fears about who would gain control of genetic information when one of these genealogy companies falters. \n\n\"People's confidence has been shaken, in Big Tech overall, and also in consumer genomics,\" says Dr. Brandon Colby, the founder and CEO of Sequencing.com, a biotech company that performs whole genome sequencing. \"The need to be extra obvious about transparency is really important. There's no room for people to go and assume that we're trying to do something shady.\"\n\nSequencing stresses the company's \"Privacy Forever\" commitment to consumers, which details that it sells no data to pharmaceutical companies, government agencies, or other outside parties, which is how some genomics companies generate revenue. Colby says Sequencing generates revenue from monthly subscriptions and by selling reports it produces based on genome sequencing that can show consumers details about their reaction to medications or offer tips on better sleep or nutrition strategies.\n\nHochhauser echoes a similar refrain at Ancestry. Users control their own biological samples and DNA data, and have the freedom to delete that information from the service if they'd like. The same approach will be taken with the AI-related content that may be generated from iMemories data. It is up to users how they want to share it, he says.\n\n\"We are a family history company,\" Hochhauser says. \"Consumers own their data, control their data, and we have multifactor authentication, as an example, and lots of different security protocols in place to protect and preserve data.\"",

      "description": "Twenty years ago, an explosion occurred in professional baseball as traditional baseball scouts — relying on decades of personal experience — collided with data scientists bringing new approaches and technology into the evaluation of baseball players. There were raucous debates on which approach would reign supreme: human expertise or numbers and statistics? We now know that neither approach would win out; the best baseball teams across the major leagues rely on a mix of human expertise and advanced statistics to provide the most complete assessment of talent. \n\nFast forward to today and a similar tension has formed in the field of defense wargaming , where traditional wargamers — relying on years of expertise and bespoke game designs — are coming to grips with rapid advances in modeling and simulation and artificial intelligence. \n\nAt the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, we have been living and breathing that tension as we have worked to incorporate generative AI and modeling and simulation into defense wargaming. The results of that work? We don't think we need a 20-year debate. Just like in baseball, the future of wargaming lies in a marriage of modeling and simulation, human expertise and AI. \n\nTo understand why wargaming is having its \"Moneyball\" moment , you have to first unpack what makes traditional wargaming so valuable. Wargaming is fundamentally about human decision-making, but its magic is in the experiential learning opportunities the games provide . War is never simple. There is no \"all-seeing eye\" that provides perfect information. Hence, wargaming explores how humans make decisions in imperfect scenarios, and how other humans respond to those decisions. \n\nArmies of psychologists have spent entire careers attempting to understand human decision-making. It's not easy to boil down to numbers and equations. Moreover, it's conveyed through conversation, discussion and debate, something that technology has yet to harness or replicate. \n\nWargames have served as an indispensable tool in this exploration. They provide a way to exercise the decision-making process, explore why choices were made and determine what the implications might be. However, being human-centric isn't always efficient. Wargames often require months of planning by experienced wargamers who deeply understand the defense issues at play. They also require human players with the expertise to emulate the various parties in a conflict. All this means wargames are often hosted on an annual cycle and can only explore a small number of the potential scenarios a national security leader might encounter. \n\nAfter all, how many people could plausibly play the role of Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping? \n\nBut with the advent of generative AI, we now have the ability to ask a computer to harness human language and, at a minimum, plausibly approximate human conversation and decision-making. That opens an opportunity to merge technology and wargaming in a way that hasn't previously been possible — meaning we can bring wargaming to a wider audience over a broader set of possible scenarios. \n\nCombine AI and physics-based modeling and simulation, which can traceably adjudicate how interactions between military platforms will play out (think whether or not an F-35 will be detected), and suddenly you can run wargames with a much smaller number of human players across a much larger number of scenarios . Because the artifacts of these games are captured digitally, you can then rapidly conduct assessments of exactly what happened and why it happened — which is incredibly labor-intensive in traditional wargaming. \n\nWhile AI skeptics may rightfully point out that the future of AI has been overhyped for literally decades, we are no longer talking about the future of AI. It is a valuable addition to the wargaming toolkit right now — today. We know this because, with AI tools and a modeling and simulation backbone, we are building new scenarios in just days with a mix of AI and human players to explore numerous iterations, branches and variations of a conflict. \n\nAre those AI players infallible? Far from it. But the ability to rapidly iterate the game — you can rewind and replay any move in a matter of seconds — allows you to explore a range of human and AI behaviors and begin to see the breadth of possible outcomes in any military scenario. And when you find that scenario that is critically important for human decision-makers to consider? That is when traditional wargaming really shines. Let national security leaders have that discussion and debate so that they can apply human judgment to the most consequential and important decisions. \n\nThe future of wargaming isn't about traditionalists versus technologists. It's about traditionalists and technologists working together, just like it was and is in professional baseball. We don't need 20 years of debate to arrive at that conclusion. \n\nAndrew Mara is the head of the National Security Analysis Department at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) where he leads the analytic team assessing the capabilities needed to solve the most pressing national security challenges; Kelly Diaz leads the Advanced Concepts and Capabilities program at APL, which aims to address complex national security challenges and inform strategic decision-making through innovative and data-driven approaches; Kevin Mather leads a team of analysts at APL in the development of advanced modeling and simulation analysis tools, including advanced framework for simulation, integration and modeling (AFSIM) and AI techniques to support complex national security analysis and decision-making.",

      "description": "Tech giant Microsoft (MSFT) is scheduled to report its fiscal fourth‑quarter earnings on July 30, after the market closes. Analysts expect the company to earn $3.38 per share, which would be an increase of 14% year-over-year. Furthermore, revenue is projected to come in at $73.8 billion compared to the prior year's $64.7 billion.\n\nElevate Your Investing Strategy:\n\nTake advantage of TipRanks Premium at 50% off! Unlock powerful investing tools, advanced data, and expert analyst insights to help you invest with confidence.\n\nIt is worth noting that investors will be closely watching Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, which is expected to generate $28.9 billion in revenue. This equates to a year-over-year increase of more than 22%. When breaking down the numbers further, its cloud platform Azure is projected to grow at about 34–35% in constant currency. This is slightly more than the 33% growth seen in the previous quarter, when AI services accounted for a large portion of the increase. Unsurprisingly, the Intelligent Cloud segment has been the firm's main growth driver over the past several years, as demonstrated in the image below.\n\nSeparately, Microsoft's Productivity and Business Processes segment is expected to rise by about 11–12% from last year to roughly $32 billion. Investors will also be paying attention to Microsoft's capital expenditure plans (capex) and profit margins. Interestingly, the company spent close to $80 billion on capex in Fiscal 2025 in order to expand its AI infrastructure, which includes custom chips and new data centers. However, management has previously said that it will slow down the pace of its capex growth in Fiscal 2026.\n\nWhat Do Options Traders Anticipate?\n\nUsing TipRanks' Options tool, we can see what options traders are expecting from the stock immediately after its earnings report. The expected earnings move is determined by calculating the at-the-money straddle of the options closest to expiration after the earnings announcement. If this sounds complicated, don't worry, the Options tool does this for you. Indeed, it currently says that options traders are expecting a 4.1% move in either direction.\n\nIs MSFT Stock a Buy?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on MSFT stock based on 30 Buys and three Holds assigned in the last three months. Furthermore, the average MSFT price target of $558.71 per share implies 9% upside potential. At the same time, TipRanks' AI analyst has an Outperform rating with a $558 price target.\n\nSee more MSFT analyst ratings\n\nDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an Issue",

      "description": "News\n\n30 Jul 2025\n\nNestlé is reviewing the future of several of its vitamin, mineral, and supplement (VMS) brands.\n\nThe brands, including Nature's Bounty, OSTEO BI-FLEX, and Puritan's Pride, were acquired just four years ago when the conglomorate purchased The Bountiful Company for $5.75 billion.\n\n© iStock/Victor Golmer\n\nThe review, announced by CEO Laurent Freixe at Nestlé's half-year results presentation, comes as the company looks to streamline operations and shift investment toward higher-margin, science-led brands such as Garden of Life and Solgar.\n\n\"We are... taking decisive measures to... focus our vitamins, minerals, and supplements business on winning premium brands,\" said Freixe.\n\nAccording to Nestlé's half-year results for 2025, organic sales rose by 2.9%, but real internal growth was flat at 0.2%. Reported sales fell by 1.8% to CHF 44.2 billion (€45.5 billion), impacted by currency effects.\n\nAcknowledging \"negative impact from tariffs currently in place and current foreign exchange rates\", the company reaffirmed its profit margin target of at least 16% while highlighting \"heightened risks from continuing macroeconomic and consumer uncertainties\".\n\nRealignment across the nutraceutical industry?\n\nIn a LinkedIn post, Emily Austin, head of nutraceuticals and ingredients executive search at Hartmann Young, described the development as part of \"major strategic moves in the nutraceutical sector\".\n\nShe noted that Nestlé's VMS divestiture echoes similar developments at healthcare manufacturing company Lonza and ingredients company dsm-firmenich.\n\nLonza announced its plans to exit its capsules and health ingredients business in December last year, noting that the segment has faced weaker demand since the pandemic. The company's share price rose significantly after the announcement.\n\nMeanwhile, dsm-firmenich divested its omega-3 fish oil business to KD Pharma Group in October 2024, and sold its stake in the Feed Enzymes Alliance to Novonesis for €1.5 billion in June this year, as part of the process of exiting its animal nutrition and health business entirely.\n\nReturning to core business\n\nAustin said she expected to see increased demand for biopharma and nutraceutical contract manufacturing services, as well as more opportunities for omega-3, capsule manufacturing, and ingredients with high growth.\n\n\"Global players are exiting legacy nutraceutical units to sharpen their portfolio strategy,\" she wrote.\n\nSeveral industry insiders commented on the trend in response to Austin's post.\n\nDmytro Sudak, sales director at Teva Pharmaceuticals, wrote: \"This points to a shift from broad volume plays to margin-led precision. Large portfolios aren't being broken up due to weakness, but to double down where science, differentiation, and value intersect.\n\n\"CDMOs benefit, but so do focused operators who know how to commercialize targeted health platforms.\"\n\nChristian Duchow, co-founder and director at Personalized Remedies, highlighted increased interest from investors and brands for their business, adding: \"With AI making end users more informed, it's increasingly difficult to justify legacy supplement brands that lack real efficacy.\n\n\"The market is shifting towards science-based solutions, and companies are adjusting accordingly.\"\n\nChristian Leighton, a nutrition and health consultant, described the trend as a course correction.\n\n\"A strong theme running through these examples is companies looking to focus on their cores – often, prior expansions beyond it turn out to be expensive mistakes that need to be rectified,\" he wrote.",

      "description": "Lying about your age is a time-honored practice. People did it well before the internet was invented, and they'll do it until the heat death of the universe. But the internet makes it uniquely easy to lie about your age. 'Age verification' on most websites includes ticking a box. Some get fancy and ask you to enter a birthdate. \n \nWe personally think an effective age verification system would involve asking someone to identify a floppy disk…But maybe that just shows our ages. \n \nAnd we'll admit it: YouTube seems to have found a better system. \n \nThe Google -owned platform has historically faced issues with distinguishing young users from adults, which means kids have been able to access YouTube in the same way adults can. In the U.S., that becomes a serious legal problem, thanks to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act , aka COPPA , which makes it illegal for digital platforms and services to collect, use, and/or disclose personal information collected from kids under 13. \n \nThe Federal Trade Commission  fined YouTube $170 million for COPPA violations back in 2019. Its ruling also led to YouTube making sweeping changes like disabling ads and comment sections on videos it thinks are aimed at kids . \n \nNow, YouTube is introducing a machine learning system that it says will be able to distinguish between young viewers and adults. \n \nThe system uses AI, which YouTube and Google parent Alphabet has invested a lot in over the past couple years, and says is paying off for it in quarterly earnings . The AI works by rolling into a user's account and \"interpret[ing] a variety of signals\" from it, like what kinds of videos the user searches for, the categories of videos they watch, and how old the account is. \n \nIf the system thinks an account is being operated by a kid/teen, it'll automatically apply limits, including disabling ads, turning on YouTube's suite of digital wellbeing tools, and \"adding safeguards to recommendations, including limiting repetitive views of some kinds of content,\" YouTube said in a company blog post. \n \nIt added, \"YouTube was one of the first platforms to offer experiences designed specifically for young people, and we're proud to again be at the forefront of introducing technology that allows us to deliver safety protections while preserving teen privacy. Families trust YouTube to provide a safe and enriching experience, and we'll continue to invest to protect their ability to explore safely online.\" \n \nYouTube says the system is going out to a small set of users in the U.S. first, and that it'll be \"closely monitored\" before it goes out to more people. It'll apply to signed-in accounts only, across desktop, mobile, and connected TV usage. \n \nIn the wake of the $170M FTC ruling, YouTube's new policies on kids' content hit channels and videos that weren't making content for children. People like adult reviewers of action figures and those who made fan content for shows like  My Little Pony suddenly found their channels ad-less and comment-less, impacting their revenue and ability to engage with their communities. YouTube has course-corrected since, but we still occasionally see restrictions on videos that don't appear to be aimed at kids. \n \nThat being said, YouTube already has plans for how to handle potential mistakes from this new system. \n \n\"If the system incorrectly estimates a user to be under 18, they will have the option to verify that they are 18 or over, such as using a credit card or a government ID,\" it said. \"We will only allow users who have been inferred or verified as over 18 to view age-restricted content that may be inappropriate for younger users.\" \n \nWorth a mention: YouTube is introducing this system after losing a tooth-and-nail fight against Australia. The country down under is on the cusp of introducing a law that will fine big social media platforms that fail to take \"reasonable steps\" to keep kids under 16 from creating accounts. Originally, YouTube was slated to be exempt from this law, but Australia reconsidered. So, beginning this December, YouTube could be on the hook for more cash if it can't effectively age-gate . We're assuming this new system will be a key player in its plan to avoid fines. \n \nVisit Tubefilter for more great stories.",

We have the Chinese approach. Now we're seeing the US approach. I think what's needed is for those approaches to dialogue,\" Bogtan-Martin said.\n\nThe Geneva-based agency, which sets the world standards in tech, is believed to offset such divisions by promoting multilateral dialogues.\n\nBogdan-Martin also warned that national policies often operate in isolation, which could make AI a growth enhancer of inequalities rather than a path towards common prosperity, considering that 2.6 billion people are still offline and not exposed to AI at all.\n\nDigital divides threaten AI's promise\n\nWhile praising AI's \"mind-blowing\" potential in healthcare and education, Bogdan-Martin highlighted stark disparities: women hold fewer than 22% of AI jobs globally, and offline populations face total exclusion from the technology's benefits. \n\n\"We have to tackle those divides if we're actually going to have something that is beneficial to all of humanity,\" she said.\n\nThe ITU will focus on infrastructure investment and capacity building in developing countries to ensure that AI does not exacerbate the existing disparities.\n\nThe Trump administration is funding Bogdan-Martin's re-election campaign, and it is crucial to prioritize these equity objectives.

      "description": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming established practices in multiple areas across all industries, and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are not immune to this transformation. From the exploratory phase to due diligence, including contract drafting and negotiations, AI enables M&A teams to leverage powerful tools for analysis, automation, and prediction, thus improving efficiency, accuracy, and objectivity. While this is still an emerging use case, studies indicate we can expect to see AI leveraged in a majority of M&A deals in the coming years, offering businesses an opportunity to be at the forefront of this revolution and leverage the benefits of AI ahead of their competitors. This article outlines the main contributions of AI at each key stage of the process, highlighting concrete benefits for companies: time optimization, risk reduction, improved decision-making quality, and stronger strategic alignment.\n\nRapid and intelligent opportunity identification\n\nAI can first help companies enhance and deploy their M&A strategy. AI tools, combined with advanced analytics can help companies better identify opportunities worth pursuing and reduce the risk of low-yield acquisitions. M&A teams save time, cover a broader range of opportunities, and can spot emerging targets before competitors, by leveraging such AI tools. By analyzing historical data and market trends, AI can anticipate future performance and integration risks. It can also simulate different scenarios on negotiations and business integration to help deal teams make well-informed decisions with respect to the pursuit of a potential M&A opportunity.\n\nMore sophisticated M&A teams can leverage automated systems that continuously monitor the market, identify targets aligned with corporate goals, and prioritize them according to defined criteria such as size, complementary offerings or corporate culture. With the help of AI, these criteria can be adjusted in real time based on various factors, including market feedback and business orientations. By automating part of the selection process, decisions based on personal preferences are limited, enhancing objectivity and decision-making rigour. This approach helps structure external growth efforts and accelerates decision-making. In short, integrating AI into these processes can ultimately improve the quality of decisions, increase operational efficiency and align acquisitions with the company's strategic objectives.\n\nOptimized due diligence\n\nThe due diligence phase, essential in any M&A process, involves a thorough analysis of a large volume of legal, financial, and operational documents. This process can be optimized significantly with the help of AI, which can review contracts, financial reports or regulatory documents rapidly, enabling business advisors (including lawyers and accountants) to work more efficiently. AI tools can identify sensitive clauses, legal obligations, or areas of non-compliance flagged as being of relevance or interest, thereby allowing businesses to quickly assess their comfort level regarding certain issues, as identified by AI.\n\nBeyond saving time, AI can provide strategic value by highlighting sensitive financial data, revealing accounting irregularities, or identifying underlying trends that could impact the viability of the transaction. Algorithms can also detect anomalies in cash flow or identify recurring discrepancies between forecasts and actual results, which can foreshadow structural weaknesses. With its predictive capabilities, AI also helps anticipate and mitigate against post-acquisition risks, as well as providing critical assistance in the evaluation of a target's future performance. In short, AI can transform due diligence into a faster, more reliable, and more well-informed process, reinforcing both the legal and financial security of the transaction for all parties involved.\n\nAI-assisted drafting and negotiation\n\nAI can play a significant role when drafting contractual documents and conducting negotiations as part of an M&A operation. Certain tools can quickly generate draft contracts based on past transactions and integrate standard clauses tailored to the contemplated transaction, incorporating insights from the due diligence phase. In this way, the use of AI tools enables legal teams involved in the transaction to ensure comprehensive contract drafting adapted to the client's targeted needs, while limiting the risks of potential litigation. Additionally, AI can be used to standardize documents from one transaction to another, which is particularly useful for fast-expanding companies with a more aggressive M&A strategy. \n\nDuring negotiations, AI can also be used to compare different versions of documents and help identify and respond to problematic clauses. These practices provide advantageous information to the party using AI, enabling it to anticipate risks that could jeopardize the transaction. This informational advantage can put them in a favourable position to bring negotiations to a successful conclusion. \n\nConclusion\n\nThe integration of AI into M&A processes and related activities represents a major step forward, both strategically and operationally. By automating complex tasks, improving the quality of analysis and reinforcing the rigour of decisions, these tools offer significant potential to optimize every stage of a merger or acquisition. The use of AI in an M&A context also allows stakeholders to focus their efforts on the most strategic aspects of these transactions, which can be critical in a company's lifecycle.\n\nHowever, it remains essential to keep in mind the challenges tied to the responsible use of AI technologies, particularly regarding ethics, data confidentiality, and governance. These considerations will be explored in greater detail in an upcoming article.\n\nThe authors would like to thank Anne-Florence Desjardins and Félix Baril-Cyr, students, for their contribution to preparing this legal update.",

      "description": "Researchers at Edith Cowan University (ECU) have developed a cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) system that could support medical professionals in detecting and accurately diagnosing the stage of disease in a range of serious health conditions, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetic eye complications, and cancer.\n\nThe AI system, named the Supervised Contrastive Ordinal Learning algorithm, uses routine and noninvasive medical images such as bone density scans and ultrasounds not only for the early detection of diseases, but also to highlight disease-specific changes that help in staging and clinical interpretation.\n\nECU researcher Dr. Afsah Saleem has highlighted the urgent need for noninvasive technologies to assist with the detection of medical issues such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR).\n\nGlobally, CVD affects over 640-million people and in Australia, the disease is responsible for one in every four deaths. Similarly, diabetic retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of blindness, currently impacts more than 103 million adults worldwide, a number projected to rise to 160 million by 2045. In Australia, nearly 1.9 million people have diabetes, and about one-third develop DR over time.\n\n\"These chronic diseases are often difficult to detect in the early stages because they lack obvious symptoms. Current diagnostic methods frequently rely on manual assessments of medical scans, which is a time-consuming, expensive, and subjective process,\" Dr. Saleem said.\n\n\"Being a machine learning scientist and working in medical imaging, our aim is to prevent or delay permanent health losses from chronic diseases.\"\n\nThis AI algorithm has already been successfully applied across multiple medical domains.\n\n\"Using this algorithm, we achieved 85% accuracy and 79% sensitivity in identifying Abdominal Aortic Calcification (AAC), an early indicator of CVD. We also obtained 87% accuracy and 84% sensitivity in diagnosing DR, and 91% accuracy in identifying different stages of breast cancer,\" Dr. Saleem said.\n\n\"The main work of our research group focuses on using the least invasive and least costly methods to accurately predict potential medical conditions which could affect the population,\" ECU senior lecturer Dr. Syed Zulqarnain Gilani said.\n\n\"The innovative aspect of the developed algorithm lies in its ability to capture and learn the distinctive characteristics of both healthy and unhealthy individuals. Subsequently, the algorithm effectively differentiates these traits to identify individuals afflicted with disease with remarkable precision.\"\n\nDr. Saleem will be presenting her research into DR at the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Conference, in Korea, later this year.\n\nMore information:\nAfsah Saleem et al, Deep-Attention Feature Fusion Network for Automated Diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy Using Fundus Photographs, 2024 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications (DICTA) (2025).

      "description": "The current era presents a dynamic IT environment, with deployment needs and specifications in constant flux. The rapid growth of AI and cloud – as well as the accompanying transition from predominantly cloud-based IT deployments to more AI-intensive workloads – brings with it changing resiliency and redundancy ratios, evolving cooling and power delivery methods, and escalating rack densities to support them all.\n\nDuring his GTC 2025 keynote, for example, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang alluded to the company preparing for racks reaching 600 kW expected in the second half of 2027 and potentially even megawatt levels in the coming years.\n\nThis underscores a critical question: How can data center builders, operators, end-users, and investors safeguard their IT and asset investments and guarantee the longevity and adaptability of today's infrastructure for the inherently unpredictable future?\n\nThe answer is to have an adaptive data center and infrastructure, and build flexibility and modularity into the design, construction, and day-to-day operations of your facility to future-proof deployments, maximize asset lifespan, and give your business the agility it demands in today's dynamic IT landscape.\n\nSuch an approach begins with design, construction, and what Aligned Data Centers has dubbed 'adaptive modular infrastructure', or the use of standardized, prefabricated modules for various building components.\n\nRelated:Micro Data Centers: A Practical Guide for Small IT Teams\n\nA Foundation for Change\n\nHistorically, data center construction has relied heavily on traditional, stick-built methods. These conventional approaches often require sequential, onsite assembly of complex systems, from power and cooling to communications and control.\n\nWhile this method served well in the past, it is now confronted by a host of challenges, including accelerated deployment times, dynamic technology changes, labor constraints, and unpredictability in quality and cost. In a market where even minor delays can have significant repercussions, the need for a more reliable and agile solution is clear.\n\nModular construction has evolved from prefabricated components and assemblies to a full-scale modular manufacturing process. Previous achievements in prefabricating components such as UPS containers, generators, chiller packages, and switch gear have set the foundation for a more integrated and advanced approach.\n\nToday, we are modularizing critical systems like power distribution, communication networks, and cooling systems. These modular components are manufactured offsite in controlled environments, ensuring high-quality standards and precision while reducing the need for onsite labor.\n\nThis strategy not only minimizes the risk associated with onsite construction but also enhances overall safety and predictability of deployment schedules.\n\nBuckle Up, and Rapidly Scale Computing Resources\n\nThe core advantage of adaptive modular infrastructure lies in its ability to deliver unprecedented speed-to-market. By manufacturing repeatable, standardized modules at dedicated fabrication facilities, construction teams can bypass many of the delays associated with traditional onsite assembly.\n\nModules are produced concurrently with the construction of the base building. Once the base reaches a sufficient stage of completion, these prefabricated modules are quickly integrated to create a fully operational, rack-ready data center environment. This \"plug-and-play\" model eliminates many of the uncertainties in traditional construction, significantly reducing project timelines and enabling customers to rapidly scale their computing resources.\n\nFlexibility is another defining characteristic of adaptive modular infrastructure. The modular design approach is inherently versatile, allowing for design customization or standardization across multiple buildings or campuses. It also offers a scalable and adaptable foundation for any deployment scenario – from scaling existing cloud environments and integrating GPU/AI generation and reasoning systems to implementing geographically diverse and business-adjacent agentic AI – ensuring customers achieve maximum return on their capital investment.\n\nThis adaptability is essential for AI workloads, where processing demands fluctuate significantly due to real-time data and analytics. This modular approach enables data centers to evolve alongside AI applications, accommodating dynamic requirements without costly retrofits and preserving the building asset's long-term value.\n\nMitigate Risks and Lower Costs\n\nEconomic efficiency and risk mitigation are also at the forefront of adaptive modular infrastructure strategy. Offsite fabrication in controlled, indoor environments enables consistent quality control and predictable cost management.\n\nWith fewer workers required onsite, the risks associated with labor shortages and safety incidents are greatly reduced. This approach not only leads to lower labor costs but also minimizes material waste and mitigates the risk of project delays. In an era of tight supply chains and fluctuating material prices, such predictability is invaluable.\n\nFurthermore, a robust supply chain strategy, which is built on loyal partnerships and the pre-purchase of critical equipment, ensures that all necessary components are available when needed, reducing the likelihood of costly supply chain disruptions.\n\nGood for Business, Good for the Planet\n\nEnvironmental sustainability is an increasingly important consideration for large-scale data center deployments. Traditional construction methods often involve significant material waste and environmental impact, including heavy use of concrete and extensive onsite labor. In contrast, adaptive modular infrastructure minimizes waste by relying on precise, repeatable manufacturing processes that produce fewer components and generate less debris. The reduced need for onsite construction not only cuts down on Scope 3 emissions but also fosters a more sustainable, environmentally friendly construction process. This commitment to sustainability is a key driver for hyperscalers and enterprises looking to reduce their overall environmental footprint while still achieving high performance and operational efficiency.\n\n \n\nA Paradigm Shift in the Way Data Centers Are Built\n\nAside from the immediate benefits of speed and efficiency, data center providers must ensure their facilities are designed to accommodate future advancements in digital technology as part of an ongoing, long-term strategic vision.\n\nThe rapid expansion of AI and cloud applications has fundamentally altered the expectations placed on data center infrastructure. Customers today demand systems that are not only robust and secure but also agile enough to scale on-demand.\n\nBy providing a flexible and scalable foundation, adaptive modular infrastructure allows end-users to deploy computing resources optimally configured for the intense, variable demands of modern digital workloads. The ability to rapidly add or reconfigure modules in response to shifting requirements ensures that data center providers remain at the forefront of technological innovation.\n\nThat said, adaptive modular infrastructure is more than just a construction methodology, and its benefits extend beyond mere design/build efficiencies. It represents a paradigm shift in the way data centers are built, delivered and operated.\n\nWith the increasing adoption of AI and cloud technologies, the future of digital infrastructure will be defined by its ability to adapt and innovate. A commitment to modular, offsite fabrication and rapid integration encapsulates a broader vision for this future, one where speed, reliability, and sustainability are not mutually exclusive but are integrated into a single, cohesive framework. By embracing adaptive modular infrastructure, organizations can ensure that their data centers are not only prepared for current technological challenges but are also primed to meet the challenges while capitalizing on the opportunities of the future.",

      "description": "Imagine a classroom that doesn't require a school building. A learning environment designed around your neighborhood, led by trusted teachers, and powered by technology that puts families in the driver's seat. This isn't some distant dream—it's happening now through platforms like Edefy, a new education technology startup that connects parents with educators to create microschools right where they live.\n\nEdefy takes inspiration from the likes of Uber and Airbnb, offering a marketplace where parents, teachers, and even homeowners with available space can collaborate to build flexible, sustainable learning communities. As public confidence in traditional schooling models continues to shift, Edefy's approach paves the way for a localized, lower-carbon, AI-supported model of education that caters to the needs of modern families.\n\nIn this article, we'll explore why traditional schooling is losing relevance, how Edefy works, and what this movement toward decentralized education means for communities, sustainability, and the future of learning itself.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n(Credit: Intelligent Living)\n\nQuick Facts: What Is Edefy?\n\nWhat it is: A tech-powered platform that connects families, teachers, and learning spaces to form microschools.\n\nLaunch Date: July 2025, after more than two years of pilot testing with real families.\n\nBusiness Model: Three-sided marketplace similar to Uber or Airbnb.\n\nWho it's for: Parents seeking alternatives to public school, teachers looking for autonomy, and hosts with space to spare.\n\nSustainability impact: Reduces commuting, utilizes underused real estate, and fosters hyper-local education.\n\nWhy Traditional Schooling Is Losing Its Hold on the Future\n\nThe Factory-Model Legacy\n\nFor over a century, the structure of public education has changed little. Society designed large institutions, standardized curriculums, and rigid schedules for a time when it prioritized uniformity and industrial efficiency. This \"factory model\" worked when preparing students for predictable jobs in predictable systems.\n\nBut in today's world, where adaptability, creativity, and individualized learning paths are more valuable than ever, that one-size-fits-all model is starting to break down. Traditional schools often struggle to support diverse learning needs, family schedules, and community engagement. And from a sustainability standpoint, sprawling school infrastructure contributes to transportation emissions and resource waste that no longer align with environmental goals.\n\nParental Disenchantment and the Rise of Choice\n\nPost-pandemic education disruption accelerated a broader realization: families want more say in how—and where—their children learn. Many parents began to explore homeschooling, hybrid models, and local learning pods. For some, this meant organizing small groups of students with shared educational values; for others, it meant seeking alternatives due to overcrowding, cultural misalignment, or lack of personalized attention in traditional schools.\n\nAt the same time, the availability of Education Savings Accounts (ESAs) and voucher programs in states like Arizona has made it more financially feasible for parents to explore non-traditional options. This expanding access fuels demand for innovative solutions like Edefy, which helps structure and scale what was once a patchwork of informal microschooling attempts.\n\n(Credit: Intelligent Living)\n\nEnter Edefy: The Uber-Style Platform Powering Microschools\n\nHow It Works: Three-Sided Marketplace\n\nAt its core, Edefy is a digital coordination tool that simplifies the process of creating microschools. It connects three essential components:\n\nFamilies seeking customized, local education for their children.\n\nTeachers looking to offer instruction outside of traditional institutions with more autonomy and better compensation.\n\nHosts who provide physical spaces—homes, churches, or co-working locations—for learning pods to operate.\n\nUsing the app, families can browse local educators, form groups (typically 8–12 children), and reserve space for classes. Teachers benefit from higher earning potential—up to $240,000 annually with full enrollment—while hosts can generate passive income by offering flexible venues.\n\nIt's a platform that turns education into a community-coordinated effort, removing layers of bureaucracy and placing trust directly in local networks.\n\nA Platform Rooted in Community Design\n\nWhat makes Edefy more than a marketplace is its focus on community. Rather than replacing schools with digital interfaces, it enables families to physically gather, form bonds, and design learning environments that reflect shared values. It's a bottom-up model of education—where local knowledge and mutual trust play central roles.\n\nThat community-first orientation also makes it more sustainable. By encouraging short-distance travel or even walkable pods, Edefy cuts down significantly on transportation emissions. It allows families to repurpose spaces already available in their neighborhoods, reducing the need for new buildings and their associated environmental costs.\n\nReal Families, Real Classrooms: Pilot Insights\n\nBefore its full launch in July 2025, Edefy operated pilot pods in Texas using community venues like churches and family backyards. These early test sites demonstrated strong demand and uncovered key operational needs—from background checks and safety protocols to scheduling tools and parent dashboards.\n\nThe platform's founder, James Bisenius, views these pilots not just as technical tests but as a proof of concept that learning can happen anywhere, as long as people are willing to collaborate. The next phase, he notes, will focus on refining the app through weekly feature rollouts based on real-time user feedback.\n\n(Credit: Intelligent Living)\n\nGreen by Design: Sustainability Built into the Model\n\nLess Commuting, Less Infrastructure Waste\n\nOne of the most immediate environmental benefits of Edefy's microschool model is the drastic reduction in daily commuting. Traditional schools often rely on fleets of buses, parent drop-offs, and large parking lots—all of which contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and urban congestion. In contrast, Edefy encourages families to form learning pods based in their own neighborhoods or even on the same block, allowing for walkable, bike-friendly schooling.\n\nThis hyper-local approach not only saves time and stress but also directly lowers the carbon footprint associated with daily education. It's a subtle but powerful shift—one that treats the school run like any other outdated commute in need of reinvention.\n\nRepurposed Real Estate: From Church Basements to Backyards\n\nSchools are some of the most resource-intensive buildings in any city. Heating, cooling, maintenance, and infrastructure upgrades all come at a cost—not just financially, but environmentally. Edefy turns that model on its head by facilitating the use of existing, underutilized spaces.\n\nViable learning hubs can be created from churches with empty classrooms during the week, homes with converted garages, and even local co-working spaces. By using what's already available, the platform promotes a circular approach to community assets—reducing construction waste and promoting sustainable urban design.\n\nThe approach not only empowers local property owners to participate in the education economy but also lowers the environmental impact of new facility development, aligning Edefy with the core principles of regenerative design and spatial efficiency.\n\nEducational Carbon Footprint: How Pods Compare\n\nDespite the lack of formal studies on microschool emissions, an increasing amount of anecdotal and modeled data indicates significant environmental advantages. Fewer miles driven, lower heating and cooling demands, and decreased material waste (no cafeteria trays, fewer single-use school supplies) all add up.\n\nAs Edefy and similar platforms scale, their data infrastructure could begin tracking sustainability metrics more directly—offering real-time feedback to families on how their educational choices support planetary health.\n\n(Credit: Intelligent Living)\n\nThe Human Future of AI-Enhanced Learning Pods\n\nAI as a Coordination Tool, not a Teacher Replacement\n\nArtificial intelligence often gets lumped into the \"robots replacing humans\" narrative, especially in education. But Edefy flips that idea on its head. The platform uses AI not to replace teachers, but to empower them—handling administrative matching, scheduling, and even group formation logistics.\n\nIts algorithms help pair families with like-minded goals, surface qualified teachers nearby, and suggest suitable host locations—all while minimizing human workload. In this way, AI becomes the invisible glue binding community members together, not a flashy replacement for classroom dynamics.\n\nPersonalized Dashboards and Predictive Scheduling\n\nOne of Edefy's most exciting promises lies in future versions of the platform: parent dashboards that offer real-time insights into a child's progress, teacher feedback systems, and predictive features that help plan the next semester based on interests or learning gaps.\n\nThis predictive element—powered by pattern recognition—will help families proactively evolve their learning path, rather than just reacting to test scores. Done right, this will support not just academic growth but emotional and social development as well.\n\nKeeping the \"Human\" in Human Learning\n\nWhile Edefy is clearly a technology platform, its success depends on deep human connection. It facilitates face-to-face learning, eye contact, peer bonding, and personalized mentorship—all the intangible things that make learning feel alive.\n\nRather than digitizing the classroom, it uses algorithms to re-humanize it—bringing people together more intelligently and meaningfully than the rigid school zones of the past.\n\nChallenges Ahead: Regulation, Access, and Scale\n\nCan This Model Serve Diverse Communities?\n\nA platform like Edefy will inevitably face questions about equity. While some families can quickly adopt pod schooling, others face barriers—financial, technological, or logistical. For Edefy to fulfill its promise, it must ensure affordability and accessibility across income levels and geographies.\n\nThis means partnering with public funding programs, offering need-based subsidies, and developing mobile-first features for families without broadband. It's a challenge worth tackling head-on—because decentralization only works if everyone gets a seat at the table.\n\nNavigating Policy and Oversight\n\nEducation policy is a patchwork across the U.S., and microschools operate in a legal gray area in some states. Edefy must work within each region's laws regarding curriculum standards, background checks, and teacher certifications.\n\nThe good news? The platform already incorporates safety protocols and is designed to adapt quickly to regional needs. But questions of accreditation, testing alignment, and liability will remain ongoing concerns—and areas for thoughtful expansion.\n\nBuilding Trust in a New Ecosystem\n\nFor many families, leaving traditional schooling is a leap of faith. That trust is earned not just through convenience but through transparency: verified educator profiles, parent reviews, host site inspections, and responsive customer support.\n\nEdefy's long-term success will hinge on building a brand that is not just smart and sustainable but trustworthy. Much like Airbnb introduced trust signals for strangers sharing homes, Edefy will need to normalize this new ecosystem of collaborative schooling.\n\n(Credit: Intelligent Living)\n\nFinal Thoughts: A New Path Forward for Education\n\nThe world is changing rapidly. As our communities become more dynamic, our learning systems need to catch up—and Edefy represents a compelling step in that direction.\n\nBy blending the efficiency of digital platforms with the warmth of neighborhood schooling, it allows families to regain control, teachers to reclaim purpose, and students to thrive in environments designed with them in mind. And by embedding sustainability into its DNA—from reducing emissions to rethinking infrastructure—it ensures that education isn't just smarter but also kinder to the planet.\n\nMicroschools aren't a trend—they're a reimagination of what school can be when we decentralize power, reconnect locally, and lean into education technology that serves people, not replaces them.\n\nYour Questions About Edefy, Answered\n\nWhat Exactly Is a Microschool?\n\nA microschool is a small, community-based learning group—usually 8–12 students—led by a qualified educator, often outside of the traditional school system.\n\nHow Does Edefy Work for Parents?\n\nParents use the platform to find local teachers, form pods with other families, and reserve learning spaces. It's akin to establishing your own educational institution, minus the bureaucratic obstacles.\n\nIs Edefy Legal in Every State?\n\nIt depends. In states with school choice laws or ESAs, it's easier to fund and operate pods. In states without school choice laws or ESAs, families should check their local regulations. Edefy provides guidance during sign-up.\n\nCan Teachers Really Earn More on This Platform?\n\nYes—by teaching full pods (8–12 students), teachers can earn significantly more than in public school settings, especially in areas with education funding flexibility.\n\nWhat Does It Take to Host a Learning Pod?\n\nHosts need a clean, safe space and basic amenities. Edefy helps with background checks and setup guidance. Many churches, homes, and community centers already qualify.",

Jeff Landry announced that an agreement was reached with a new vendor to overhaul the Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles' (OMV) decades-old system.\n\nAccording to information from the Landry's office, CHAMP uses a System as a Software (Saas) model to make title management easy with a digital system of record, automation, and AI for fraud prevention. The vendor has provided services to other states, including West Virginia, Kentucky, New Jersey, and Illinois.\n\n\"Ultimately, we want to give our citizens a choice and make it much easier for them to renew their driver's license, address issues at OMV, or register their vehicle. We want to try to get them in a position, if they want to, that they will be able to do everything online or on the app,\" Landry said on his \"Diner Days\" podcast.\n\nFDA cracks down on kratom related products\n\nThe agreement is expected to cost Louisiana $30 million and take two years to complete. Landry's office said the proposed contract with FAST would've taken over 30 months and cost $58 million.\n\n\"You had three different vendors out there, and the one picked will end up saving the state $30 million, plus our citizens are going to get a new platform,\" Landry said.\n\nBackground on OMV outage problems\n\nIssues with the OMV's system started in March when technical outages impacted drivers statewide. The Office of Technology Services (OTS) immediately launched an investigation, and Landry declared an emergency the next day.\n\nLandry ordered a temporary suspension of important rules and waived expiration rules for Class E driver's licenses. He called the over-50-year-old OMV system \"unsustainable.\"\n\nIn the same month, Landry announced leadership changes for OMV. The former leader, Dan Casey, resigned as OTS continued its investigation into outage issues. Bryan Adams, who was the leader of the Louisiana State Fire Marshal, was named as the new commissioner days later.\n\nLandry gave Adams credit after the aging OMV system saw improvements in April amid ongoing repairs.\n\nWhy LSU Student Food Pantry will get $52K\n\nLatest News NYC shooting: What we know about the victims\n\nMeet BBB stars and win big at Bulls, Bands & Barrels event\n\n2025 Nissan Armada Gets More Power and Tech\n\nGreene says she's not running for Georgia governor",

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), as well as two micro-cap stocks Oil-Dri Corp. of America (ODC) and Park Aerospace Corp. (PKE). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today's research reports here >>>\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens, attempting to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action.

The company is experiencing strong momentum fueled by growth in AI semiconductors and continued success with its VMware integration. Strong demand for its networking products and custom AI accelerators (XPUs) has been noteworthy. \n\nBroadcom's AI segment benefits from custom accelerators and advanced networking technology that supports large-scale AI deployments with improved performance and efficiency. Broadcom expects third-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 60% year over year to $5.1 billion. The acquisition of VMware has benefited Infrastructure software solutions. \n\nAs of the fiscal second quarter, roughly 87% of Broadcom's largest 10,000 customers have adopted VMware Cloud Foundation. However, gross margins in the fiscal third quarter are expected to contract sequentially due to unfavorable revenues and product mix. High debt levels are also a headwind.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Broadcom here >>>)\n\nShares of Berkshire Hathaway have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry over the year-to-date period (+6.4% vs. +5.1%). The company is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies, with numerous diverse business activities. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts, and is indicative of its financial flexibility. \n\nContinued insurance business growth fuels an increase in float, drives earnings and generates maximum return on equity. The non-insurance businesses have also been doing well in the last few years. The insurer has also started increasing its investment in Japan. A sturdy capital level provides further impetus. \n\nHowever, exposure to cat losses induces earnings volatility and also affects underwriting results. Huge capital expenditures remain a headwind. Also, it remains to be seen how the behemoth fares when Greg Abel succeeds Warren Buffett as CEO of Berkshire.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Berkshire Hathaway here >>>)\n\nJohnson & Johnson's shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the year-to-date period (+17.4% vs. +2.6%). The company beat Q2 estimates for earnings and sales. Its Innovative Medicine unit is showing a growth trend, driven by key products like Darzalex, Tremfya and Erleada and continued uptake of new launches, like Spravato, Carvykti and Tecvayli. \n\nThough in the MedTech segment, sales are being hurt due to headwinds in China and competitive pressures in some categories, the Cardiovascular segment is contributing to growth. J&J expects sales growth in both segments to be higher in the second half than in the first. J&J is making rapid progress with its pipeline, and has been on an acquisition spree lately.\n\nHowever, the Stelara patent cliff and the potential impact of Part D redesign will be significant headwinds in 2025. The uncertainty around the talc lawsuits and pharma tariffs lingers.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Johnson & Johnson here >>>)\n\nShares of Oil-Dri Corp. of America have outperformed the Zacks Chemical - Diversified industry over the past year (+81.8% vs. -17.8%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $840.09 million is well-positioned for long-term growth, driven by a structural shift toward renewable diesel, where its fluids purification segment posted 22% growth for the first nine months of fiscal 2025.\n\nWith expanding capacity across North America, demand for ODC's solutions is poised to rise, ensuring stable margins and revenue durability. The Ultra Pet acquisition accelerates growth in the pet care segment, expanding the higher-margin crystal litter portfolio. The B2B segment shows strong operating leverage, highlighted by a 43% year-over-year gain in ag product sales. \n\nWith $36.5 million in cash, low debt, strong cash flow, and no drawdown on its $75 million credit line, ODC retains significant strategic flexibility. A recent stock split enhances liquidity, supporting further investor interest and capitalizing on long-term market trends.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Oil-Dri Corporation of America here >>>)\n\nPark Aerospace's shares have gained +40.1% over the past year against the Zacks Aerospace - Defense Equipment industry's gain of +50.5%. This microcap company with a market capitalization of $354.03 million posted strong Q1 FY26 revenue growth (+10.2% YoY to $15.4M), driven by robust aerospace and defense demand. Key programs like the A321XLR and LEAP-1A, plus defense contracts for missile components, continue to scale up. \n\nThe company boasts a rock-solid balance sheet with $65.6 million in cash, no debt, and a strong current ratio, enabling self-funded expansion and consistent shareholder returns. Park declared its 41st consecutive annual dividend, with a 3.7% yield and over $603 million returned since FY05. Strategic positioning in next-gen aerospace and defense composites supports long-term demand visibility. \n\nHowever, rising SG&A costs and customer concentration via non-guaranteed volume contracts pose risks. Broader supply chain delays and inventory build-ups raise concerns about working capital efficiency. Shares trade at 4.6x EV/sales and 22.5x EV/EBITDA. \n\n(You can read the full research report on Park Aerospace here >>>)\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Las Vegas Sands Corp.

However, a challenging macro environment and high debt are concerning.\n\nSubsea Unit with iEPCI model Aids TechnipFMC (FTI)\nThe Zacks analyst believes that TechnipFMC's unique Subsea products will lead to strong growth but modest performance in the Surface Technologies segment raises concern.\n\nFrequent Business Wins Aid BorgWarner (BWA) Amid Rising Costs\nPer the Zacks analyst, frequent business wins are likely to support BorgWarner's top-line growth. However, high research and development costs remain a concern.\n\nLow Fuel Costs Aid American Airlines (AAL), High Debt Ails\nLow fuel costs are aiding the company's bottom line.

      "description": "Recently both the United States and China have announced national policies for promoting the development of artificial intelligence. The Trump Administration's U.S. AI Action Plan features a deregulatory approach to driving innovation and building an American AI infrastructure that can be exported overseas. The Chinese Government AI plan instead proposes a global consensus-building organization that would seek a balance between AI development and security.\n\nThe competition between these 2 contrasting approaches may be expected to have major implications for the adoption of AI around the world, and, thus, for the future of the global economy. A consistent deregulatory emphasis might be a winning American strategy.\n\nAmerica's AI Action Plan\n\n\"America's AI Action Plan,\" released by the White House on July 23, 2025, states that \"America must have the most powerful AI systems in the world,\" and \"must also lead the world in creative and transformative application of these systems. Achieving these goals requires the Federal government to create the conditions where private-sector-led innovation can flourish.\"\n\nThe Action Plan features 3 pillars: (1) accelerate AI innovation; (2) build American AI infrastructure; and (3) lead in international AI diplomacy and security. The first pillar merits particular attention.\n\nAccelerate AI Innovation.\n\nThe AI Innovation pillar includes a variety of specific initiatives designed to support the rapid adoption of and application of AI by government, businesses, and workers.\n\nReducing regulatory burdens is the key policy that underpins the overall Trump AI innovation strategy.\n\nMost significantly, \"all Federal agencies . . . identify, revise, or repeal regulations, rules, memoranda, administrative orders, guidance documents, policy statements, and interagency agreements that unnecessarily hinder AI development or deployment.\" The clear aim is to eliminate excessive federal AI regulation, to the extent legally possible.\n\nBiden-era Federal Trade Commission enforcement actions that \"advance theories of liability that unduly burden AI innovation\" are to be set aside.\n\nState AI regulation is actively discouraged, to the extent allowed by law.\n\nThe AI plan also takes aim at state AI regulations that interfere with the Federal Communications Commission's ability to carry out its statutory responsibilities.\n\nFurthermore, the Plan seeks to discourage excessive state-level AI regulation by steering AI-related discretionary federal funding away from states whose \"regulatory regimes may hinder the effectiveness of that funding or award.\"\n\nThe AI Action Plan's deregulatory tilt reflects continued support for the U.S. policy of \"permissionless innovation,\" which drove the development of the internet from its beginnings in the 1990s. Permissionless innovation means \"that anyone should be able to innovate without having to seek permission from a government or other authority.\" That policy allowed the internet to grow freely without U.S. Government regulatory authorization and oversight placed over the firms that developed it. The direct result was unprecedented innovation and huge economic dividends generated by U.S. firms, benefiting the American and global economies.\n\nPermissionless innovation does not mean freedom from legal requirements that protect health, safety, and business on the merits. AI innovators, like the internet pioneers that came before them, remain fully subject to the full range of U.S. civil and criminal laws, including national security, antitrust, consumer rights, environmental protection, and civil rights, to name just a few.\n\nBy reducing the expected weight of regulatory burdens, the AI Plan may be expected to incentivize additional investments in and the faster implementation of AI systems.\n\nIn turn, these effects could stimulate American competition in AI-related sectors and speed innovation, providing economic growth dividends and benefits to American businesses and consumers. American international competitiveness in AI and AI-related markets would benefit.\n\nBuild American AI Infrastructure\n\nNine separate proposals are aimed at creating a robust American AI Infrastructure. These include deregulatory streamlined permitting for AI-supported infrastructure, promoting an AI-supportive electric grid, developing a skilled workforce for AI infrastructure, and ensuring cybersecurity.\n\nAI Diplomacy and Security – Countering the Chinese Threat\n\nThis pillar emphasizes exporting American AI to allies and partners; strengthening AI-related export controls, national security protections, and risk assessments; and countering Chinese influence in international governance bodies.\n\nThe Action Plan notes that international organizations that are proposing AI governance frameworks and development strategies too often have advocated for burdensome regulations, vague \"codes of conduct\" that promote cultural agendas that do not align with American values, or have been influenced by Chinese companies attempting to shape standards for facial recognition and surveillance.\n\nIn response, the Action Plan recommends \"leverage[ing] the U.S. position in international diplomatic and standard-setting bodies to vigorously advocate for international AI governance approaches that promote innovation, reflect American values, and counter authoritarian influence.\"\n\nChinese Government Global Plan for AI\n\nChinese Premier Li Qiang proposed a global organization to oversee the development of AI in a July 26 speech, just 3 days after the release of the American AI Action Plan.\n\nAccording to the Chinese Government, Li \"call[ed] for the early formation of a global framework and rules that have broad consensus to guide the development and use of AI.\" Li noted the need \"to strike a balance between development and security.\" He added that China is willing \"to offer more Chinese solutions.\" In particular, \"China stands ready to undertake joint technical research with other countries, and will be more open in sharing open-source technology and products.\"\n\nChina's support for a new global AI authority (though cloaked in \"consensus-building\" language) stands in sharp contrast to the Trump Administration's deregulatory, competition-driven American AI model, which the U.S. would seek to promote through economic diplomacy focused on existing international bodies and friendly nations.\n\nThe Big Competition\n\nThe 2 recent government announcements provide a preview of the coming global competition between contrasting American and Chinese AI models.\n\nChina and the U.S. are widely regarded as the 2 major global players in AI.\n\nChina\n\nChina is a formidable force in AI development. China's 2017 New Generation AI Development Plan revealed its intention to become the global leader in AI by 2030. China's Government has worked closely with its tech giants to make them AI leaders, and has encouraged the collection of data to build AI models. Chinese agencies and businesses have introduced AI at all levels.\n\nChina has aggressively sought to have Chinese AI systems adopted in Asia, Africa, and South America. Moreover, with government support, Chinese firms are opening offices and entering partnerships in the Middle East, Europe, and the U.S.\n\nChina is also investing heavily in AI education and in AI military applications.\n\nThe U.S.\n\nThe U.S. still leads \"leads the world in large-scale AI development, driven in part by its leading talent and innovation ecosystem, but also by its access to cutting-edge 'compute' – the specialized chips, data centers, and infrastructure needed to train and deploy the most capable AI systems.\"\n\nThe U.S. Government is not emulating China's heavy government control over AI development.\n\nThe AI Action Plan's provisions dealing with labor and infrastructure reflect a \"light touch\" approach. They primarily feature encouragement through easing burdens on the private sector, rather than detailed industrial policy directives.\n\nMost significantly, the AI Action Plan has an overarching deregulatory focus. It leaves it to entrepreneurs to produce new AI innovations, free from government micromanagement.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCompetition on the merits among competing AI systems, like competition in general, should tend to benefit society. It can be a \"win\" for economic welfare worldwide, yielding an optimal array of products and services.\n\nThe extent of direct Chinese Government involvement in developing and promoting its vision of AI is, however, a complicating factor. The U.S. Government may be expected to resist Chinese policies that would generate anticompetitive market distortions in AI markets.\n\nA consistent U.S. Government approach of deregulation and \"permissionless invitation\" just might be the \"secret sauce\" needed to achieve global success for American AI, assuming geopolitical obstacles are surmounted.",

      "description": "- The evolution and impact of AI, especially with respect to national security, is poorly understood, but the explosion of knowledge is unprecedented, according to Dr. Eric Schmidt, chair of the Special Competitive Studies Project (SCSP).\n\nIn a fireside chat on \"Delivering the AI Advantage,\" at the year's AI + Expo, Dr. Schmidt discussed whether AI is over- or underhyped. \"The arrival of this level of intelligence is an issue as historic as the invention of electricity,\" he said.\n\nThe 2025 AI+ Expo and The Exchange: Advancing the Legacy of Innovation and National Security was sponsored by the SCSP, a non-profit initiative focused on strengthening America's long-term competitiveness in AI and other emerging technologies. \n\nDr. Schmidt noted the implications of AI in improving America's military advantage, with some recent successes and gaps where improvement is needed.\n\nSuccess Story. Although the details are not publicly available, a recent project called Maven involved the creation of an open-source library that can be trained to look for certain things. \"In the Pentagon, they spend a lot of time looking for things,\" and it is much smarter to have the computer looking and the human is alerted if it finds something, or detects a trend or pattern, he said.\n\nGaps: The expanded role of drones in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine highlights the need for more development of remote AI technology in the U.S., according to Schmidt. The war in Ukraine has become drone against drone, he said. By contrast, the U.S. does not as a nation have a good UAS counter drone, Schmidt added.\n\nLooking ahead, the U.S. military needs to be proactive in taking advantage of AI, said Schmidt. His ideal defensive strategy would include two layers of drones, a high surveillance level with deep-looking cameras connected by an unjammable AI network, and other drones that could deploy bombers. With this kind of defensive system \"it would be essentially impossible to invade a country by land,\" he said.\n\nThe key takeaway, Schmidt said, is that the military needs to use modern AI tools to plan defensive strategies. Companies in the U.S. are ready to take on this challenge, but need to establish and improve partnerships, he added.\n\nVisit  to learn more about SCSP and view other presentations from the AI + Expo.",

The asset gained 31% over the three-month period ending June 30.\n\nWith its earnings release, shares in MARA Holdings (MARA) spiked to a high of 7.5% in after-hours trading on Tuesday to $17.82 before cooling to $17.22.\n\nMARA closed Tuesday trading down 3.2% at $16.61. Its shares have gained 58% since a slump in mid-April but have largely traded sideways for most of this year.\n\nMARA said that shortly after the end of Q2, its Bitcoin holdings surpassed 50,000 BTC, which it touted as \"solidifying our position as the second-largest corporate public holder of Bitcoin\" behind MicroStrategy.\n\nDuring the second quarter, MARA mined 2,358 BTC, up 3% from the 2,286 produced in the previous quarter. Its energized hashrate of 57.4 exahashes per second (EH/s) gained 6% from 54.3 EH/s in Q1.\n\nRelated: Mara to raise up to $1B for Bitcoin and operations via debt sale\n\nThe firm's Bitcoin holdings increased 170% to 49,951 BTC, worth around $5.3 billion as of the end of June. It currently holds $5.87 billion worth of the asset and is second only to Strategy, which holds a whopping 607,770 BTC worth $71 billion.\n\nThe firm also announced strategic partnerships with Google-backed TAE Power Solutions and LG-backed PADO AI to co-develop grid-responsive, load-balancing platforms for next-generation AI infrastructure.\n\nMARA is targeting 75 EH/s by year-end and sees a significant opportunity in the growing AI and data center market.\n\n\"Our vertically integrated mining operations, large BTC treasury, budding international energy partnerships, and early AI infrastructure investments each contribute distinct and measurable value,\" said CEO Fred Thiel.\n\nMagazine: Robinhood's tokenized stocks have stirred up a legal hornet's nest",

      "description": "Energy costs are rising this summer, and it's not entirely because you're sitting in front of your air conditioner for 16 hours a day wondering why people prefer this season over winter.\n\nNo, it's mostly due to the prevalence of AI data centers, the power-sucking buildings that allow users to ask generative AI bots like Grok if something is true:\n\nPJM Interconnection provides electricity to 13 states and Washington, DC, and is considered a bellwether for the rest of the US.\nIts customers are seeing a spike in energy bills as high as 20% this summer. The boom in AI data centers is the main culprit.\n\nWhy are residents paying for Big Tech's power needs? PJM conducts a yearly capacity auction, during which utilities in the states it serves pay to ensure they have enough power to cover peak usage days. Last year, capacity prices at auction rose by 833%, and the impact is now being felt. An independent monitor attributed three-quarters of those increases, which are eventually passed onto customers, to the demand from existing (and impending) data centers.\n\nBut it's not just data centers\n\nIn addition to a supply/demand imbalance and inflation, factors causing the monthly double take at your energy bill include:\n\nThe heat dome that has hovered over parts of the US this month, which was found to be a result of \"human-caused climate change,\" per the climate impact nonprofit Climate Central.\nCostly upgrades to modernize and solidify the grid against climate disasters. Those expenses are often recouped by companies through higher electricity rates.\nInterconnection queues, aka the time it takes for approval to connect more power generators that would decrease costs to the grid, can take up to five years.\n\nBottom line: Relief may not be coming any time soon. President Trump promised to cut energy costs in half during the first 12 months of his administration, but a report from a nonpartisan think tank foresees prices rising due to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.—DL\n\nBecome smarter in just 5 minutes\n\nMorning Brew delivers quick and insightful updates about the business world every day of the week from Wall St. to Silicon Valley.",

      "description": "T his topic is near and dear to me! With several members of my family in the social work and therapy fields (my wife being one), discussions with <p>my wife over the past few days, and previous articles about AI, it only seemed right to get this info into the hands of practitioners and decision makers.</p> <p> The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini is rapidly reshaping professional landscapes, including healthcare, social work, and therapy. As these technologies become increasingly available, many professionals are asking the right question: Can AI responsibly support clinical thinking and case consultations without compromising client privacy or professional ethics?</p> <p> The answer is a qualified yes, but only with the proper safeguards in place. AI tools can serve as valuable companions for clinical reflection, helping practitioners think through diagnoses, explore treatment planning options, and consult on de-identified case material. However, AI's use must be approached with caution and a strong ethical framework. Most importantly, organizations and practitioners must ensure compliance with HIPAA and uphold the fundamental values of confidentiality, client autonomy, and professional integrity.</p> <p> Why Ethics and Privacy Must Come First</p> <p> Before using any AI tool, organizations should first establish clear boundaries around how information is entered, processed, and retained. A fundamental rule: never input personally identifiable information into these systems. This includes all 18 identifiers protected under HIPAA, such as names, specific dates, addresses, or account numbers. Instead, when discussing a case, use generalized or fictitious demographics (e.g., \"a 35–45-year-old woman in the Midwest experiencing anxiety and disrupted sleep\").</p> <p> Staff must also be trained in approved prompt protocols — the exact wording used when engaging with LLMs. Standardized prompts help protect privacy and ensure consistency across the organization. For example, rather than asking about a real individual's case, a prompt might read:</p> <p> \"I am a licensed mental health professional seeking consultation on a hypothetical case. Based on the de-identified details below, please offer diagnostic and treatment suggestions using DSM-5-TR criteria.\"</p> <p> Building a Responsible AI Usage Model</p> <p> Organizations should create a structured framework for using AI in a clinical or social work setting. Below are six essential building blocks:</p> <p> 1. Complete Data De-Identification</p> <p> Strip all 18 HIPAA identifiers before input</p> <p> Use fictional or generalized demographic info when necessary</p> <p> 2. Approved Prompt Protocols</p> <p> Develop a standardized prompt format</p> <p> Train staff in prompt design that balances utility and privacy</p> <p> Document prompt usage for compliance</p> <p> 3. Enhanced Anonymization Measures</p> <p> Use a VPN to mask IP and location data</p> <p> Avoid personal or business accounts; opt for generic logins</p> <p> Prioritize AI platforms that offer Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)</p> <p> 4. Platform Selection</p> <p> Free consumer AI tools are typically not HIPAA-compliant</p> <p> Choose HIPAA-ready platforms that offer BAAs and data protection guarantees</p> <p> Keep detailed records of the platforms used and their compliance status</p> <p> 5. Key Safety Features</p> <p> Always frame prompts within a clinical consultation context</p> <p> Be explicit that data should not be stored</p> <p> Focus on abstract clinical reasoning — never use real names or details</p> <p> 6. Additional Safeguards</p> <p> Log all prompt usage for audit purposes</p> <p> Randomize internal case numbers to avoid accidental re-identification</p> <p> Sample Prompt for Secure AI Use</p> <p> Here is a simple, standardized prompt example you can modify and use internally:</p> <p> \"I am a licensed mental health professional seeking clinical consultation on a hypothetical case scenario. Please provide diagnostic considerations and treatment recommendations based on the following de-identified information. Do not store or use this information for training purposes.\"</p> <p> Case Scenario:</p> <p> Client demographics: [Age range], [Gender], [General geographic region if relevant]</p> <p> Presenting concerns: [Symptoms without identifying details]</p> <p> Duration of symptoms: [Timeframe]</p> <p> Relevant history: [De-identified background information]</p> <p> Current functioning: [General assessment without specifics]</p> <p> Consultation Requests:</p> <p> Please suggest potential diagnostic considerations from DSM-5-TR</p> <p> Recommend evidence-based treatment approaches</p> <p> Include possible differential diagnoses and further assessments</p> <p> Next Steps for Your Organization</p> <p> This moment presents an opportunity — not just to use AI — but to lead responsibly in how it is introduced into social work, mental health, and human services. Consider taking the following actions:</p> <p> Conduct a risk assessment to evaluate potential privacy exposures</p> <p> Develop a formal AI usage policy , with input from legal, compliance, and ethics committees</p> <p> Train staff on safe and effective AI practices</p> <p> Review usage regularly to align with emerging privacy standards and platform changes</p> <p> With thoughtful design and implementation, AI tools can assist in clinical reasoning without compromising the sacred trust between practitioner and client.</p> <p> References and Resources</p> <p> AI Platforms to Explore:</p> <p> Further Reading on HIPAA and AI Adoption:</p> <p> Note: For organizations interested in developing their own internal AI standards, consider working with clinical leadership, legal counsel, Experts in Cyber Security, and ethics boards to create a model that reflects your mission and values.

      "description": "AI can write our words, but it can't replace our presence.  I still remember my high school prom like it was yesterday. <p>My parents let me take their white Cadillac for the night — a big deal back then. And the coolest part? That car had one of the first mounted cell phones. Not the bulky bag phones people lugged around — this one lit up bright neon green when you held it to your ear. I thought I was the height of sophistication, driving that Cadillac and holding that glowing phone like I was on top of the world.</p> <p> A few years later, in college, the internet came along. Suddenly everyone was talking about \"email.\" I had to get someone to show me how it worked. I remember thinking, wow, this is living. Back then, you could either be on the phone or online — not both. If someone picked up the landline while you were connecting to the \"World Wide Web,\" you'd get booted off instantly.</p> <p> It felt like magic. But what started as convenience — first cell phones, then email — quietly began to reshape how we connect.</p> <p> The Shift Begins — When Tech First Took Over</p> <p> The truth is, this drift away from personal connection didn't start with AI. It began when technology became more about speed than substance.</p> <p> Email was one of the first big signs. It cut out the need for a phone call, which might have included small talk, laughter, or a human pause to listen. With email, you could skip all that — just the facts. No tone. No warmth.</p> <p> Then came texting. Suddenly, full conversations were reduced to abbreviations and emojis. We went from \"How are you really doing?\" to \"wyd?\" Texting made it easier to stay in touch — but also easier to disconnect emotionally.</p> <p> Smartphones deepened that shift. We became reachable at all times, yet less present than ever. We traded eye contact for screen time and real conversations for quick replies.</p> <p> What used to take thought and intentionality now takes seconds — and sometimes, no thought at all.</p> <p> Enter AI — Help or Hindrance?</p> <p> Now we've entered a new era. Artificial Intelligence is no longer science fiction — it's in our homes, our hands, and even our writing.</p> <p> I'll be the first to admit it: tools like ChatGPT are impressive. I've used it myself to organize thoughts, brainstorm, even help me get unstuck when I'm writing. It's a time-saver, no doubt.</p> <p> But here's the part that's easy to miss: the more we rely on AI to do the talking, the less we may show up ourselves.</p> <p> We're outsourcing not just tasks, but personality. Emotion. Voice. That human imprint that says, \"This came from me.\"</p> <p> AI can mimic connection, but it can't replace presence. It can replicate tone, but not intention. It can find the right words, but it can't feel them.</p> <p> That's the danger: we start using tech as a shortcut for connection instead of a tool to enhance it.</p> <p> The Risk — From Efficiency to Emotional Distance</p> <p> When everything becomes more efficient, it's easy to assume we're doing better. After all, faster communication feels like progress.</p> <p> But connection doesn't work that way. Relationships aren't measured in typing speed. They're built on presence, patience, and small details that tell someone they matter.</p> <p> We've become so used to convenience that we rarely stop to ask: Did I show up personally — or just respond quickly?</p> <p> The risk isn't just that we'll communicate faster — it's that we'll stop noticing the difference between meaningful and mechanical.</p> <p> The Way Forward — Keeping It Personal</p> <p> Technology isn't the enemy — it's a tool. And like any tool, it's all about how we use it.</p> <p> We don't have to choose between progress and presence. We can still be efficient and intentional. Use AI to think, plan, brainstorm — but let your own voice do the speaking.</p> <p> Write the message yourself — even if it takes longer. Leave a voice memo instead of just a thumbs-up emoji. Handwrite a note for someone who isn't expecting it.</p> <p> The challenge isn't to resist innovation — it's to protect connection. Because no matter how advanced the tools become, nothing replaces the power of personal.</p> <p> Conclusion — Presence Can't Be Programmed</p> <p> Not long ago, a friend sent me a handwritten card out of the blue. It wasn't fancy — just a short note saying how much they appreciated me. It probably took them five minutes to write. But it meant far more than any text ever could.</p> <p> That's the part technology can't do for us. It can't slow down. It can't care.</p> <p> And maybe that's the most radical thing we can do in a world obsessed with speed — take the time to show up in a way that only a human can.</p> <p> Because no matter how advanced the future gets, people will always remember one thing — how we made them feel.</p> <p> Mark Stratton is a Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor who writes about emotional wellness, personal growth, and relationships. He provides intensive home-based therapy for youth and families, works in private practice offering outpatient counseling, and is currently writing a book titled People Really Can Change. He believes real change is possible when insight meets intentional action.</p>",

      "description": "Boeing Associate Technical Fellow /Engineer /Scientist /Inventor /Cloud Solution Architect /Software Developer /@ Boeing Global Services <p> In the rapidly evolving landscape of financial markets, automated trading systems have emerged as indispensable tools, enabling swift and data-driven decision-making. The Python codebase serves as a practical example, showcasing a sophisticated cryptocurrency trading bot meticulously engineered to operate autonomously on the Kraken exchange. This article delves into the architectural design, core functionalities, and underlying predictive analytics principles that govern this robust automated trading solution.</p> <p> At its heart, the bot adheres to several fundamental software engineering and artificial intelligence principles. Modularity and separation of concerns are paramount, with the system segmented into distinct, specialized classes. This design choice not only enhances code readability and maintainability but also facilitates independent development and testing of individual components. Furthermore, robustness and comprehensive error handling are deeply embedded, anticipating and mitigating common challenges in real-time trading environments, such as API rate limits, exchange downtime, and authentication failures. Critical issues are immediately flagged through an integrated email notification system, ensuring timely human intervention when necessary. This comprehensive error handling ensures the bot's reliability even in the face of unexpected challenges.</p> <p> The bot's operational intelligence is derived from a data-driven decision-making process , rooted in quantitative analysis. A key player in this process is the FeatureEngineer, a class that transforms raw market data into a rich set of technical indicators. It leverages well-established technical indicators, including Simple Moving Averages (SMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Average True Range (ATR), alongside Volume Moving Averages (VMA) . These indicators, calculated by the FeatureEngineer from historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data , are the building blocks of the bot's predictive analytics. Crucially, the parameters governing these indicators and the associated trading thresholds (e.g., profit targets, stop-loss levels) are not static. Instead, they are dynamically optimized using Bayesian optimization via the Optuna framework . This advanced hyperparameter tuning process allows the bot to systematically explore a vast parameter space, identifying configurations that have historically maximized profitability during backtesting. This continuous learning from historical performance is what fundamentally positions the bot as a predictive analytics system , where past patterns are analyzed to forecast future market conditions conducive to profitable trades.</p> <p> The key technical indicators utilized in the cryptocurrency trading bot, as calculated by the FeatureEngineer componen t and used by the TradeDecisionEngine for its predictive analytics, are:</p> <p> Simple Moving Averages (SMA):</p> <p> fast_sma: This is a shorter-period Simple Moving Average. It's designed to be more responsive to recent price fluctuations, helping to identify immediate trends or shifts in momentum.</p> <p> slow_sma: This is a longer-period Simple Moving Average. It provides a smoother, more stable representation of the underlying price trend, filtering out short-term noise.</p> <p> Usage: The bot's strategy is designed to adapt to changing market conditions. It often looks for \"crossovers\" between the fast and slow SMAs. A \"golden cross\" (fast SMA crossing above slow SMA) can signal a bullish trend, while a \"death cross\" (fast SMA crossing below slow SMA) can signal a bearish trend. This adaptability ensures the bot can respond to evolving market dynamics.</p> <p> Volume Moving Averages (VMA):</p> <p> fast_vma: A shorter-period moving average applied to trading volume. It helps in understanding recent shifts in trading activity.</p> <p> slow_vma: A longer-period moving average applied to trading volume. This provides a broader view of the average trading volume over time.</p> <p> Usage: Volume often confirms price trends. A price movement accompanied by increasing volume (e.g., fast VMA crossing above slow VMA) suggests stronger conviction behind the move, while declining volume might indicate a weakening trend.</p> <p> Average True Range (ATR):</p> <p> Usage: ATR is a measure of market volatility. It quantifies the degree of price fluctuation over a specified period, taking into account gaps and limit moves. In your bot, ATR is crucial for:</p> <p> Risk Management: It helps in dynamically setting stop-loss and take-profit levels that are adaptive to current market conditions. In more volatile markets, a wider ATR suggests larger price swings, implying stop-losses need to be set further away to avoid premature exits.</p> <p> Signal Confirmation: A rising ATR can indicate increasing market interest and the potential for a significant price move, while a low ATR might suggest consolidation or a lack of interest.</p> <p> Relative Strength Index (RSI):</p> <p> Usage: RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between 0 and 100.</p> <p> Overbought/Oversold Conditions: Typically, an RSI reading above 70 suggests the asset is \"overbought\" (potentially due for a price correction or reversal downwards). In contrast, a reading below 30 indicates it's \"oversold\" (potentially due for a bounce or reversal upwards).</p> <p> Divergence: Although not explicitly detailed in the decision logic, RSI is also commonly used to identify divergences with price, which can signal impending trend reversals.</p> <p> These indicators are fundamental to the bot's rule-based strategy, providing the data points from which the TradeDecisionEngine makes its buy, sell, or hold decisions, especially after their optimal periods and thresholds have been determined through the Optuna optimization process.</p> <p> The core functionality is orchestrated by the TradingBot class, which seamlessly integrates various specialized components:</p> <p> LoggerAndNotifier : This utility ensures comprehensive logging of all bot activities and critical events, providing an invaluable audit trail. It also dispatches real-time email notifications for significant occurrences, such as successful trades, warnings, or errors.</p> <p> StateManager : For persistent operation, the StateManager is responsible for saving and loading the bot's crucial operational state, including the last_buy_price and current position, to and from a local JSON file. This allows for uninterrupted operation across restarts.</p> <p> ExchangeClient : This component serves as the secure interface with the Kraken exchange. It handles all market interactions, from fetching real-time prices and historical data to executing trade orders. A notable feature is its implementation of a Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) strategy, which breaks down larger orders into smaller, time-distributed chunks to minimize market impact and improve execution quality. It also incorporates pre-trade checks to ensure compliance with exchange minimums and available funds.</p> <p> FeatureEngineer : This class is the analytical engine, transforming raw market data into a rich set of technical indicators. It calculates various SMAs, VMAs, ATR, and RSI, providing the TradeDecisionEngine with the necessary inputs for informed decision-making.</p> <p> TradeDecisionEngine : This is the brain of the bot, where the trading strategy's logic resides. It analyzes the latest indicator values, current price, and the bot's existing position to determine the optimal action: BUY, SELL, or HOLD. Its rules are designed to identify bullish and bearish crossovers in moving averages, assess overbought/oversold conditions via RSI, and, critically, implement sophisticated risk management through profit-taking and dynamic trailing stop-loss mechanisms.</p> <p> The TradeDecisionEngine is the component that executes the bot's trading strategy, making buy, sell, or hold decisions based on the current market conditions and the bot's predefined rules. The bot's operational flow begins with configuration loading and initialization, followed by state recovery. Depending on the TEST_MODE setting, it either embarks on an intensive parameter optimization phase using Optuna — a process that essentially trains the bot's rule-based \"predictive model\" on historical data — or transitions directly into a live trading loop . In live mode, it continuously monitors market conditions, calculates indicators, makes trade decisions based on the optimized parameters, and executes trades, diligently logging all actions and updating its persistent state.</p> <p> In conclusion, this cryptocurrency trading bot stands as a testament to the power of predictive analytics in automated financial applications. By combining modular design, robust error handling, rule-based strategies, and advanced hyperparameter optimization, it offers a sophisticated solution for navigating the complexities of cryptocurrency markets. While its current iteration relies on traditional technical analysis, its flexible architecture lays a strong foundation for future enhancements, potentially incorporating more advanced machine learning models for even more nuanced and adaptive predictive capabilities.</p> <p> Free</p> <p> Published in AI Simplified in Plain English</p> <p> Written by Frank Morales Aguilera</p> <p> No responses yet</p>",

The partnership's first project, titled Madrid South, involves a 160,000 sqm data centre campus on the outskirts of Madrid, which is expected to provide up to 150 MW of capacity upon becoming operational by 2030.\n\nThe Madrid South site has already secured a power connection close to 230 MW. The plan includes the integration of an on-site solar photovoltaic facility, supplemented by additional renewable energy sourced from Iberdrola, to supply the data centre's full energy requirements.\n\nEchelon Data Centres currently has over 600 MW of capacity either operational or in planning stages across Ireland and the UK. CPD4Green, a subsidiary of Iberdrola, has more than 700 MW power connection agreements in place at sites in the Madrid area and Aragon.\n\nSustainability commitments\n\nEchelon and Iberdrola have stated that all power required by the Spanish data centre facilities will be provided by renewable energy, aligning with the sustainability objectives of both companies and the EU's Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact. The alliance is described as underpinned by guarantees to generate and consume renewable energy for the ongoing operation of the facilities.\n\nThe joint initiative has been established to support the increasing demands for secure, environmentally-responsible digital infrastructure in Spain, while also facilitating the long-term development of renewable power generation capacity in the region.\n\nMarket context and objectives\n\nThe partnership is expected to benefit from Spain's regulatory structure, access to skilled labour and competitive renewable energy prices. This is expected to support the large-scale delivery and ongoing operation of data centre infrastructure for cloud and artificial intelligence workloads.\n\nDavid Smith, Chief Investment Officer at Echelon Data Centres, commented on the partnership and its anticipated impact for Echelon customers operating in Spain.\n\n\"Entering the Spanish data centre market has been a strategic goal for Echelon for several years. Spain has material benefits as a market for our customers; a supportive regulatory and policy environment, high quality talent from both a construction and operational perspective and access to some of Europe's lowest price renewable energy, in scale. Our partner, Iberdrola, is a world leader in building and operating generation assets and we are delighted to have this opportunity to partner together to deliver critical infrastructure for our customers.\"\n\nIberdrola emphasised its focus on supporting Spain's growing digital economy through the alliance, as well as the importance of providing data centres with reliable renewable electricity.\n\nDavid Mesonero Molina, Corporate Development Director of Iberdrola, said,\n\n\"This agreement reinforces Iberdrola's strategy of facilitating the development of data centres, which have already become a key vector for the growth in electricity demand. The alliance signed with Echelon will allow us to value our portfolio of sites with access to electricity connection and our ability to offer these infrastructures safe, clean and competitive energy 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\"\n\nThe Madrid South project represents the first in a series of developments planned under the joint venture between Echelon and Iberdrola, with both parties intending to advance additional hyperscale data centre campuses in other regions of Spain in the future.",

      "description": "Financing across the biopharmaceutical industry is at a painful crawl. Nowhere is this clearer than in the venture capital realm. Research from Citeline and Pitchbook showed that VC fundraising for biopharmas has been dropping for four straight quarters and has generally been trending downward since the pandemic-induced rush of money into the industry in 2021.\n\nHowever, some firms are still managing to scare up large venture rounds in 2025, and series A and series B funding rounds are ticking up, according to a report from . Research from PitchBook shows that though the number of raises and the total amount raised fell slightly in Q2 2025, for the past five quarters it has held steady at around $8 billion–$9 billion per quarter.\n\nHere BioSpace recaps the biggest raises of the year so far, all of which fall into hot research areas such as AI and obesity.\n\nIsomorphic Labs\n\nAmount raised: $600 million\nDisease area: Not disclosed\n\nThe biggest raise of the first half of the year went to Isomorphic Labs, a spinout of Google's DeepMind division that garnered $600 million in March to create new AI-designed drugs. Although the company has no published pipeline and hasn't announced any disease targets, only mentioning \"challenging disease areas\" in a , the company expects to start clinical trials for newly discovered molecules by the end of . Isomorphic has already bagged big partnerships with Eli Lilly and Novartis that together total nearly $ in biobucks. Now valued at nearly $1.8 billion, the company is one of a handful of , all of which are built on AI.\n\nVerdiva Bio\n\nAmount raised: $411 million \nDisease area: Obesity and metabolism\n\nWhile pharma giants like Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are leading the obesity field, a suite of smaller companies are betting on next-generation therapies to get ahead of the curve. Right around the time of the JP Morgan Conference in January, Verdiva Bio joined them with a . That money is going toward a pipeline of obesity drugs formulations licensed from the Chinese biotech Sciwind Biosciences. That includes an oral, once-per-week GLP-1 drug, as well as two amylin assets, one administered orally and one subcutaneously.\n\nPathos AI\n\nAmount raised: $365 million \nDisease area: Prostate cancer and other tumor types\n\nFollowing Isomorphic Labs' gargantuan raise, Pathos, another AI-powered biopharma startup, got a $365 million series D in to continue developing its oncology pipeline, bringing its total capital raised to $1.6 billion. Despite being an AI-focused company, its lead asset, pocenbrodib, was licensed from Novo Nordisk, which got it from Forma Therapeutics. Pocenbrodib is currently in a Phase Ib/IIa trial for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Another molecule the company is pursuing is P-500, a brain-penetrant drug licensed from Prelude Therapeutics for treating brain cancers.\n\nEikon Therapeutics\n\nAmount raised: $351 million \nDisease areas: Several, including cancer, inflammation and neurological diseases\n\nEikon, another biotech unicorn with a valuation of $1.85 billion, added a $351 million series D to an already impressive funding haul in . The new money is going towards EIK1001, a Toll-like receptor agonist for treating advanced melanoma. Eikon showed off some preliminary results at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting last year, including a 14% complete or partial response rate. According to CEO Roger Perlmutter, the company has its eye on an eventual IPO.\n\nNumab Therapeutics\n\nAmount raised: $227 million \nDisease areas: Immunology and cancer using multispecific antibodies\n\nFounded back in 2011, in Numab grabbed an extra $55 million in an extended series C, bringing the total raise for the round to about $227 million. That adds to an already significant ledger after Numab spun off NM26, an investigational bi-specific antibody for atopic dermatitis, into a new company called Yellow Jersey Therapeutics and then sold Yellow Jersey to Johnson & Johnson in for $1.25 billion. The new raise is going toward furthering the company's inflammation and oncology pipeline, including its lead asset, NM32, a T cell engager for solid tumors and hematological cancers.",

      "description": "Data centers have burst onto the policy scene in New Jersey both because they advance AI technology and because of their enormous need for energy. \n\nHow to handle the anticipated growth of data centers, and their energy needs, is a hot topic in Trenton. NJBIA believes the answer to energy capacity challenges is not to discourage the growth of data centers – and the economic activity and jobs they will bring – but to expand the energy supply.\n\nFrom the start, the Murphy administration's energy policy objectives have been to eliminate electric generation through fossil fuels, primarily natural gas, in favor of renewable energy, such as wind and solar. Department of Environmental Protection regulations put these policies into effect by lowering carbon emission levels for natural gas electric generation units.\n\nAt the same time, the state has been promoting the electrification of both the building and transportation sectors. The state's Energy Master Plan anticipated that these electrification policies would require a doubling or even tripling of our electric generation needs.\n\nThe results were easy to predict. New Jersey went from a net exporter of electricity to a net importer. This scenario was repeated in other states with similar carbon-reduction policies, resulting in less energy capacity in the face of higher demand. PJM, our regional grid manager, has issued numerous warnings for states not to continue to shutter nuclear and fossil plants until we can grow alternative supplies. Those warnings were ignored.\n\nWhile the electrification policies themselves have yet to have a substantial impact on demand, the unexpected growth of data centers has. Because the PJM's rate-setting structure considers future needs in a market-dominated system, the recent capacity auction has seen a tenfold increase in costs, resulting in a 20% increase in New Jersey's electricity bills.\n\nSome lawmakers have promoted bills to either require data centers to \"bring their own energy\" or \"punish\" them through higher rates. If New Jersey is to be the AI innovation state, as Governor Murphy has proclaimed, we must be able to attract high-tech data centers.\n\nRather than discourage data center growth, we should be like Pennsylvania, which has developed ample energy supplies. As a result, Amazon recently announced it is spending $20 billion to develop data centers in that state. New Jersey is on the sidelines watching our neighbor prosper.\n\nIf we want to be a leader in AI, we need to also be a leader in energy development.\n\nTo access more business news, visit NJB News Now.\n\nThe post appeared first on New Jersey Business Magazine.",

      "description": "SHANGHAI，CHINA, July  29, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — BROTHER, the renowned global printer brand, recently achieved a remarkable 30% increase in e-commerce sales by adopting PLTFRM's AI-powered virtual human livestream technology. In partnership with PLTFRM, a creative agency specialising in digital branding and communication solutions, BROTHER witnessed firsthand the commercial potential of AI-driven livestreaming for e-commerce. \n \n\n \nAI Virtual Human Livestreaming: A New Era in E-Commerce \n \nAI virtual human livestreaming is rapidly reshaping China's e-commerce landscape. These AI-generated hosts deliver interactive livestreams that closely replicate human behaviour. Even JD.com founder Richard Liu has launched an AI avatar to host his own sales livestreams, signalling growing acceptance and excitement within the industry. \n \nUnlike traditional livestreaming, which typically requires a team of 3–4 people—including a host, technical operator, and support staff—AI livestreams operate 24/7 with minimal manpower. A single digital human can handle hosting, answering audience questions, and switching products in real time, significantly reducing operational costs. \n \nToday's AI hosts are nearly indistinguishable from real people, with expressive facial gestures, lifelike voices, and fluid audience interaction. Their realism and efficiency have made them credible and cost-effective substitutes, driving measurable sales growth for brands. \n \nBROTHER PRINTER: A Century-Old Brand Embraces AI \n \nKnown for its durable and high-performance devices, BROTHER initially deployed AI livestreaming as a brand visibility tool during off-peak hours. \n \n\"We didn't expect major sales results at first,\" said Ms. Gu, Head of Branding at BROTHER China. \"Our goal was to maintain a consistent brand presence and convey our values of professionalism and reliability outside of prime-time slots.\" \n \nHowever, within just two hours of its first AI livestream powered by PLTFRM AI, the campaign generated over ¥18,000 (US$2,500+) in direct sales—far surpassing expectations. \n \nSales Up 30%, Costs Down 80% \n \nToday, BROTHER runs AI-powered livestreams across four online flagship stores on JD.com and Tmall, operating continuously 24/7. Compared with the same period last year, the brand has seen a 30% increase in sales and an 80% reduction in livestreaming costs. \n \n\"Every morning, we check the data to see how much our AI host sold while we were asleep,\" Ms. Gu shared. \"It's now part of our daily routine.\" \n \nOne particularly surprising insight: 30% of total sales occurred during late-night hours—a time previously neglected by traditional human-hosted streams. Many of these transactions came from first-time customers, drawn by the AI host's clear and professional explanations of technical product benefits—at any time of day. \n \nBROTHER's AI avatar emphasised key selling points like its separate drum-and-toner design and renowned long-term durability—hallmarks of the brand's century-long legacy of engineering excellence. \n \nBehind the Tech: PLTFRM AI \n \nThis success story was made possible by PLTFRM, a Shanghai-based brand management agency with 15 years of experience in digital marketing and over a decade in e-commerce livestreaming. Since 2023, PLTFRM has partnered with Baidu Cloud to incorporate cutting-edge AI tools into its livestreaming services. \n \nThe agency's AI Virtual Human Livestreaming Service (PLTFRM AI) provides end-to-end support—from avatar creation and product upload to scripting, audience engagement, and multi-platform integration. BROTHER's project went live within just two weeks of initial planning. \n \nStrategy First: Matching People, Product, and Place \n \nAccording to PLTFRM co-founder Qian Dejun, AI livestreaming is most effective when it follows traditional retail principles: matching the right host, product, and place. While AI lowers entry barriers, achieving real impact requires professional execution—custom avatars, optimised sales scripts, realistic virtual studios, and carefully scheduled streaming slots. \n \nMr. Qian, who has hosted over 300 livestreams and now has an AI avatar of himself, stresses that the same strategic logic applies to both AI and human hosting. PLTFRM offers fully-managed and hybrid livestream models, enabling brands to grow without the burden of technical complexities. \n \nA Full-Service, Hassle-Free Model \n \n\"We understand the pain points—low traffic, high operational costs, lack of talent, and poor ROI,\" said CEO Qian Dejun. \"That's why PLTFRM AI is a worry-free, fully-managed solution. Brands can scale faster, lower costs, and increase exposure—without building an in-house team for livestream.\" \n \nFAQ: PLTFRM AI Livestreaming \n \nQ: Which platforms does PLTFRM AI support? \n \nA: Currently live on JD.com, Tmall, Taobao and Pinduoduo. Integration is also available for Dianping,Meituan, WeChat mini-program，vip.com and others. \n \nQ: What's included in the full-service package? \n \nA: Services include product listing, avatar customisation, scriptwriting, virtual studio setup, livestream operations, and ongoing optimisation. \n \nQ: How soon can livestreaming begin? \n \nA: Livestreams can go live within 30 days of onboarding. \n \nQ: Can AI hosts be used alongside human hosts? \n \nA: Yes. Many clients use human hosts during peak hours and AI hosts during off-peak times. \n \nQ: Can PLTFRM clone an existing human host as an AI avatar? \n \nA: Yes. Full AI cloning is available. \n \nInterested in AI Livestreaming for Your Brand?

      "description": "Unilever's been building a generative AI assembly line for its digital creative. The system might offer a model for heavyweight brand peers, but could also cause a headache for creative agencies.\n\nFor the last year the CPG giant has been working with marketing services group Brandtech to build up its Beauty AI Studio: a bespoke, in-house system inside its beauty and wellbeing business. Now in place across 18 different markets (the U.S. and U.K. among them), the studio is being used to make assets for paid social, programmatic display inventory and e-commerce usage across brands including Dove Intensive Repair, TRESemme Lamellar Shine and Vaseline Gluta Hya.\n\n\"It's a different way of working. We used to send briefs off and get content back. Now it's this agile, iterative approach,\" Selina Sykes, global vp and head of marketing transformation, beauty and wellbeing, told Digiday. Sykes estimated that on average, Unilever was using the system to create 400 creative assets per product: \"Before, we'd be doing 20 assets per campaign, and now we're doing hundreds.\"\n\nWhat's Unilever actually done? \n\nThe system relies on Pencil Pro, a generative AI application developed by Brandtech Group. The tool draws on several large language models (LLMs), as well as API access to Meta and TikTok for effectiveness measurement. It's already used by hearing-care brand Amplifon to rapidly produce text and image assets for digital ad channels. \n\nIn Unilever's process, marketers use prompts and their own insights about target audiences to generate images and video based on 3D renders of each product, a practice sometimes referred to as \"digital twinning.\" Each brand in a given market is assigned a \"BrandDNAi\" — an AI tool that can retrieve information about brand guidelines and relevant regulations and that provides further limitations to the generative process. (For the tech heads, it does this using a cloud-based platform that combines LLMs, RAG frameworks and REST, or representational state transfer, APIs.)\n\nSykes said the system would not be used to create any images of people: \"We're not currently doing any human AI generation. We're doing it all around the product.\" She added that the company had used the system to produce creative assets 30% faster than its previous way of working, while other measures of advertising effectiveness such as video completion rate (VCR) and click-through rate (CTR) had doubled. \n\nSykes didn't provide an estimate of the cash savings associated with the production efficiencies, but Unilever will be aiming for double-digit percentage savings on budgets. Per Medialink, advertisers and agencies that have adopted AI into their processes have cut their creative production spending by 27%. And given that Unilever is one of the planet's largest advertisers spending £7.8 billion ($10.42 billion) on marketing last year, per its 2024 financial results, even small figures imply significant cost reductions.\n\nAI Beauty Studio hasn't just been an investment in tech for Unilever. It's meant committing to the time required to train and organize teams, too. The company first began working with Brandtech back in 2023, and began testing Pencil in first quarter 2024; much of the last year was spent designing and then administering Beauty AI Studio alongside in-housing specialist Oliver. And 25,000 staff have been given \"AI fluency training\" so far.\n\nSo, what does this mean for creative agencies?\n\nAt one point, Unilever had roughly 3,000 agencies on its global roster. But it's spent much of the last decade working to reduce that figure in 2024, when it consolidated much of its beauty and wellbeing business with British holding company WPP. (Its media business remains scattered across a wide swath of shops, however).\n\nGartner analyst Nicole Greene said that advertisers are likely to opt for \"hybrid\" approaches to AI implementation, using agencies as vanguards of AI rather than jumping into the breach themselves. Major agency groups like WPP and Dentsu have each made AI-enabled production shops key parts of their offerings, emphasizing the capabilities of their respective Hogarth and Tag units.\n\nStill, guidelines around responsible use of the tech, transparency with consumers over AI usage, data siloes and an uncertain regulatory environment are all holding advertisers back from further implementation, Green said. Despite a 2024 Gartner study found 30% of marketing leaders planned to shift more marketing work in-house over the next 12 months, another study by the consultancy suggested that only 62% of marketing staffers have had training using generative AI.\n\nFor Forrester principal analyst Jay Pattisall, those stumbling blocks might actually \"decelerate\" brands hoping to in-house. \"You'll need the agency to implement, you'll need the agency to run, you'll need the agency to transfer and train, and that takes time,\" he said. Several CPG clients, including General Motors, Mondelez and Coca-Cola have opted thus far to outsource AI production capabilities to their agency partners (Monks, Publicis, Accenture and WPP for the record) rather than drag them indoors, Pattisall noted.\n\nThat arrangement might not hold forever, though. In the long-term, agencies might find themselves asked to \"hand over\" to an in-house unit augmented by AI, Greene said. In that moment, questions over remuneration and the fundamentals of the already precarious agency business model will become critical.\n\nAnd not every creative or production agency has the tech, dev or cash available to the Brandtechs, Omnicoms or WPPs of the world. \"This type of scenario, where you're substituting a SaaS platform for production capabilities and using in-house employees to man the platform, will deter from some of the production revenues that that agencies are are accustomed to,\" said Pattisall.\n\nSykes was careful not to suggest Unilever's AI assembly line might reduce the work going for agencies. \n\n\"We see generative AI as an aid, not a replacement. In some cases, it will help to free up time for people to dedicate to the more human elements of the creative process,\" she said in a follow-up email. \"We're proud to partner with a world-renowned roster of creative agency network holding groups, independent agency teams and key technology platforms learning and building capabilities together.\"\n\nBrandtech too, are keen to emphasize they won't be selling other clients a \"cookie cutter\" approach in the shape of Unilever's solution. \"The model of transformation takes a slightly different shape in different places,\" said Rebecca Sykes, partner at The Brandtech Group [and no relation to Unilever's Sykes].\n\nBut should similar setups end up the norm among heavyweight advertisers – Brandtech already has a similar relationship with Google – alarms bells are going to start ringing in Brooklyn and Shoreditch.",

      "description": "In this week's luxury briefing, a look at earnings from LVMH and Kering, as well as the reformatting of runway shows from their brands. Also, why TikTok educational creator Tanner Leatherstein is joining British leather bag brand Stow as creative director, and how smart glasses are winning the game. For comments or tips, email me at zofia@glossy.co\n\nTariff deal news and earnings announcements have dominated the week. Europe's luxury sector breathed a sigh of relief on July 27, when the U.S. and the European Union agreed on a trade deal that places a 15% tariff on most E.U. goods headed to the U.S., averting the feared 25% rate threatened earlier this month. The move avoided what Robin Mellery‑Pratt, founder of brand intelligence company Matter, called a \"potential demand shock\" that could have forced \"a pricing and margin rethink across the industry.\"\n\nEven with that relief, luxury's biggest names are still under pressure. LVMH reported its first-half results on July 25, and Kering followed on July 29. Both underscored the challenges of balancing slowing demand, structural change and shifting cost bases.\n\nLVMH's revenue reached €42.2 billion ($46.3 billion), up 4% year-over-year, while recurring profit fell 2% to €11.5 billion ($12.6 billion). The group's fashion and leather goods division, which includes Louis Vuitton and Dior, grew 3% year-over-year but at a slower pace than the double-digit growth seen in recent years. Kering posted €7.6 billion ($8.4 billion) in revenue, down 16% year-over-year, with Gucci down 25% on a comparable basis and a group operating margin that contracted 470 basis points to 12.8%.\n\nBoth groups cited currency volatility, tourism shifts and ongoing softness in China as key challenges, but tariffs are now an immediate consideration. \"How companies execute their pricing strategies will be very significant for their success in the near and mid-term,\" said Mellery‑Pratt. \"The pushback [to price increases] is getting noisier in some channels, where consumers are coalescing via short-form video apps or Reddit threads or interest groups.\"\n\nKering CFO Armelle Poulou said on the earnings call the company has already taken selective price adjustments and may consider more, \"making sure that we apply it in a smart way, mindful of consumer sentiment.\" Francesca Bellettini, Kering deputy CEO, added that Gucci's reset under new creative leadership is beginning to gain traction, highlighting the importance of product \"novelty in the stores basically every month [and] accelerating the injection of net [sales] in the store.\"\n\nThe earnings calls also revealed another area of focus: the format and scale of upcoming runway shows.\n\nCecilie Cabanis, LVMH CFO, stressed the need to free up resources, saying, \"Efficiency is sustainable, cost‑cutting is not. We're looking at everything, from how we define store cost per square meter to how we structure relationships with agencies. It's about freeing up resources so we can keep investing behind our brands.\"\n\nThat likely includes cultural activations and shows, which are increasingly under scrutiny for cost and relevance. \"The scale of cultural presence that luxury brands have enjoyed or achieved over the last three years may not be the strategy moving forward,\" said Mellery‑Pratt. \"If budgets around amplifications and even shows are being scrutinized, it could be the beginning of a different approach with regard to cultural relevance. Rather than ubiquity, there could be a more targeted, tailored strategy.\"\n\nRecent presentations from the two luxury groups illustrate this shift. Dior's Summer 2025 men's show (June 21, Paris) featured an art‑installation‑style set rather than a stadium-scale spectacle, while Louis Vuitton's Fall 2025 show (March 3, Paris) was staged in the former Gare du Nord station with a limited audience.\n\nBeyond tariffs and show formats, both conglomerates flagged portfolio developments. At LVMH, speculation has grown around Marc Jacobs, one of the group's U.S. brands. Analysts believe its strong youth appeal and social media momentum — it's a consistent TikTok favorite — could make it a candidate for external investment or even divestiture. A deal worth $1 billion is allegedly being floated to Authentic Brands Group, owner of Reebok.\n\nAs Mellery‑Pratt said, \"Marc Jacobs has proven itself to be one of the most culturally relevant brands. Its relationship with TikTok really built another chapter of cultural relevance for the brand.\"\n\nAt Kering, the focus remains on Valentino, where it holds a 30% stake acquired last year from Qatari investment group Mayhoola for €1.7 billion ($1.87 billion), with an option to acquire full control by 2028. Executives said the brand's wholesale cleanup and aesthetic evolution are ongoing. Jean‑Marc Duplaix, Kering deputy CEO, meanwhile, emphasized that portfolio activity remains \"disciplined\" and that 2026 \"would not be the best year to exercise\" the Valentino investment option, given industry trends.\n\nTikTok creators are taking over luxury's creative director roles\n\nLuxury's latest creative directors aren't coming from design schools or heritage maisons — they're emerging from TikTok feeds. British luxury bag brand Stow London appointed Tanner Leatherstein (real name Volkan Yilmaz) as its new Director of Craftsmanship and shareholding partner. Leatherstein is a leather educator known for deconstructing luxury bags on social media. The move signals how influence is turning into operational power.\n\n\"Two videos from Tanner drove pre-orders [for one of our bags] up by thousands of percent,\" said Stow founder Carol Lovell. \"For us, it was a no-brainer. He shares our values and has already proved he can move product.\" The company declined to share financial details of the long-term partnership.\n\nLeatherstein built a 1.2 million–strong following on TikTok by cutting open luxury bags from brands like Prada, Louis Vuitton and YSL to show the quality of what's inside. He will now shape Stow's product development, sourcing and material choices while continuing his transparency-first content. He will also continue to post content and advocacy around leather supply chain issues. \"Instead of me waiting to build my brand toward this idea, we decided, 'Why don't we join forces and build this together?'\" he said.\n\nThe appointment comes as luxury faces pressure over its supply chain ethics. On July 29, Italian trade group Confindustria Moda urged a \"concrete dialogue\" after scandals linked Dior, Armani, Valentino and Loro Piana to sweatshops outside Milan, warning brands to align cost targets with fair wages and commit to long-term contracts.\n\nStow's small-batch manufacturing in Ubrique, Spain, transparent pricing and elimination of plastic reinforcements are designed to address these issues directly. But Leatherstein's shift from external critic to internal creative leader suggests something larger: consumers now trust creators to hold brands accountable, and brands are betting that credibility can translate into commercial and creative success.\n\nLyst's Q2 2025 Index: Footwear dominates\n\nThis quarter's Lyst Index shows shoppers swapping polish for personality as economic anxiety fuels demand for expressive, lower-cost accessories and statement shoes.\n\n\"Economic uncertainty is driving shoppers toward expressive, lower-cost accessories that deliver maximum impact per dollar spent,\" said Katy Lubin, vp of brand and communications at Lyst. \"When budgets tighten, people gravitate toward pieces that tell stories and signal identity rather than just demonstrate wealth.\"\n\nTop five hottest products:\n\nThe Row Dune flip-flop, a $690 minimal luxury sandal\n\nSkims Cotton Rib Tank, a viral basics leader\n\nAdidas Adicolor Sprinter Shorts, a retro athletic revival\n\nMiu Miu Suede Logo Boat Shoes, a preppy staple\n\nVibram FiveFinger V-Soul, a performance-fashion hybrid\n\nMiu Miu was the quarter's top brand, powered by the popularity of suede boat shoes, while Burberry re-entered the top how many? brand list after a year out, boosted by menswear shirting and swimwear, alongside trending women's flats and mini bags.\n\nOther notable trends in the latest Lyst Index include Y2K-fueled revivals, like Isabel Marant's Bekett wedge sneaker; nostalgic talismanic jewelry, such as Juju Vera's shell pendant necklace; and niche accessories with craftsmanship and narrative value, including Jacques Marie Mage eyewear.\n\nThe Lyst Index ranks brands and products quarterly based on global shopper searches, sales, browsing behavior and social media engagement.\n\nEarnings\n\nEssilorLuxottica's second quarter 2025 results, reported July 28, showed Ray-Ban Meta sales up more than 200% year-over-year, driven by new AI features that make the smartglasses more useful than earlier iterations. They include real-time translation and the growing adoption of prescription and transition lenses. CEO Francesco Milleri said, \"Meta, also with less margin, is making a lot of money. Volumes are growing very, very fast,\" while confirming capacity will exceed the previously planned 10 million units. The company declined to comment on sales.\n\n\"Smart glasses have definitely ceased to be an oddity — like Google Glass had been — and are becoming mainstream,\" investment fund Bernstein analyst Luca Solca told Glossyn. \"They are soon to become glasses, full stop, with traditional eyewear superseded by more functional smart products.\"\n\nNews to know\n\nInstead of a runway show, Dario Vitale's first Versace collection will debut via an intimate presentation with a video component on September 26 in Milan. In April, Prada Group acquired Versace for €1.25 billion ($1.44 billion), and Vitale was appointed the brand's chief creative officer after leaving Miu Miu.\n\nVictoria's Secret confirmed via Instagram that its runway show will return this year, following last October's Brooklyn-based comeback led by CEO Hillary Super, as the brand works to revive sales amid pressure from activist investor Barington Capital.\n\nErmenegildo Zegna Group sold a 5% stake (14.1 million shares) to Temasek Holdings for $126.4 million at $8.95 per share, raising cash to support organic growth and making Temasek a 10% shareholder while the Zegna family stake falls to 60.3%.\n\nJeremey Tahari, named CEO and creative director of Elie Tahari in February, released his first collection for the brand, sold exclusively through elietahari.com and select U.S. stores. The collection features modernized, seasonally driven designs developed in collaboration with Elie Tahari, the father of Jeremey Tahari. Prices range from $148-$498.\n\nListen in\n\nThis week on the Glossy Podcast, Danny Parisi and Zofia Zwieglinska discuss New York Fashion Week's move to a more centralized venue setup, a major International Court of Justice ruling pushing wealthier countries to curb emissions, and a money laundering case in the Netherlands involving Louis Vuitton that highlights luxury's vulnerability to financial crime.

      "description": "More than 80 media executives huddled in New York last week under the IAB Tech Lab banner to tackle a problem that's fast becoming existential: how to block AI companies scraping publisher content to train their models and capture attention — all without consent, let alone a check. \n\nThe usual suspects showed up — publishers, platforms and the tech vendors caught in between. Even Google and Meta attended. The AI companies at the centre of this storm — OpenAI, Anthropic and Perplexity — did not. No one was surprised. But their absence landed louder than any statement. \n\n\"Publishers are still very much concerned about whether those companies are even going to participate, which is why the consensus in the room was we have to block them,\" said Anthony Katsur, CEO of the IAB Tech Lab. \n\nThe hope? Put up a wall and force a conversation. That wall is taking shape in the form of a technical framework – the LLM Content Ingest API – designed to let publishers control who can access their content, and under what terms. The idea is to bake in permission and payments from the start. A formal spec is expected this fall. \n\nIf it holds, it could slow down the firehose of free content feeding AI models — and turn access into something that has to be earned, or at least paid for. \n\n\"Most of those companies aren't profitable so is there a market where if we block crawlers at large and start to starve them, will it kind of force some of them to come to the table again?,\" said Katsur. \n\nThat's the bet. A coalition is forming around it, with plans to go public, and formal, by the end of the month. \n\n\"From announcement to publication of a specification within five to six months, that's lighting fast given how fast we moved on the Privacy Sandbox,\" said Katsur. \n\nBut for all its momentum, this coalition of the willing is also defined by a different truth: it is equally a coalition of the unable – at least for now. \n\nThe reality is many AI companies have already demonstrated their willingness to ignore publisher signals. Some treat publisher guidance – like robots.txt – as advisory not authoritative. Others scrape content while masking their identities or using obfuscated crawlers. Even publishers that have implemented technical blocks still see their content siphoned.\n\n\"What's notable is that not all the LLMs are obeying block orders,\" said Katsur. \"They'll find other ways to surreptitiously continue to crawl.\"\n\nWhich is why this effort isn't about airtight enforcement. It's about building enough leverage to make ignoring publishers no longer worth it. \n\nAs several execs who were at the event put it: the time to lock arms is now while there's still something left to protect. Whether that unity holds is another matter. The temptation for some publishers to cut a deal – to trade access for short-term relief – will be hard to resist, especially in a market where pressure is mounting and margins are thin. \n\n\"Industry bodies cannot dictate commercial decisions by its members, but it can create buy-in and adoption of the standard, or the line in the sand that we're all going to act within,\" said Amanda Martin, CRO at Mediavine, who was at the event. \"That's what I'm looking to see come out of the IAB's role.\"\n\nNo one left the room thinking this would be easy. There are still too many moving parts. But the point of the meeting was never to solve the problem. It was to draw a line and, crucially, to agree on how. \n\nFirst: that the line only holds if everyone uses the same framework, one that works across the infrastructure and provides consistent tracking, control and enforcement. Without that consistency, the wall falls before its built, and publishers are back to playing whack-a-mole with anonymous crawlers. \n\nSecond: attribution isn't optional – its table stakes. No attribution means no recognition, no relationship, no visibility. Just summaries, regurgitations and AI-generated blurbs that borrow the information, context and credibility of the original – albeit without the source. \n\nAnd third: there won't be a single monetization model. What's likely to emerge is a hybrid approach – some form of pay-per-crawl, where AI companies are charred each time a bot ingests content, paired with models that pay publishers each time their content powers an AI-generated response. However the IAB Tech Lab's framework evolves, it's expected to lean toward the latter. \n\nOr, as one exec framed it, this entire push is about four 4Cs: control, consent, credit and compensation. \n\n\"It's important that the industry is coming together to think through ways to put friction into the system to make it harder for the AI systems to steal everybody's content,\" said Paul Bannister, chief strategy officer at Raptive, which sells ads for independent sites. \"We're seeing the industry come together to really think through what an ongoing payment structure between publishers and AI companies looks like.\" \n\nStill, even the most aggressive blocking effort is just one front in a much bigger battle. The larger reckoning will play out across courtrooms, regulator chambers and publisher boardrooms. That much was clear at the IAB Tech Lab meeting, where a rare thing happened: publishers walked away with something resembling hope. The no-shows from the major AI platforms didn't go unnoticed – and shouldn't be excused. But the presence of Google and Meta sent a different kind of signal: these companies are seasoned enough to know that ecosystems break when one side takes everything and gives nothing. \n\n\"If we do this right, everyone who creates information can take share in a growing market,\" said a publishing exec who attended the meeting but asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak to Digiday.\n\nThat's the hope, anyway. That common sense eventually catches up to disruption.",

      "description": "Ambition and Innovation sought to safeguard Scotland's marine ecosystems. A total of £5.5 million available for eight Challenges as part of CivTech Round 11.\n\nThe Scottish Government is looking to find an innovative solution to the problem of managing the impact of marine pen fish farms more sustainably, just one of eight new Challenges set as part of the CivTech Scotland Round 11 Accelerator.\n\nUp to £650,000 is available to develop a solution to the Challenge, which is being sponsored by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA). Anyone – an individual, team, start-up or established business, big or small – can apply.\n\nThis challenge focuses on developing a method or tool to assess impacts of marine pen fish farms (MPFF) on the ecological communities of rocky seabeds and protected marine habitats where it is neither possible nor appropriate to take a grab sample. The solution must offer a non-invasive and preferably quantitative method to monitor ecological effects. It should be scientifically robust and demonstrate its ability to detect whether MPFF operations remain within environmental limits, supporting sustainable aquaculture practices and the protection of sensitive marine ecosystems.\n\nThe Government and public sector sponsors are offering a total possible fund of £5.5 million for solutions to a range of generational and national level challenges.\n\nSolutions are also being sought to address other challenges including how to reduce teacher workload, how to unlock the cultural and economic potential of the Gaelic language, and how to reduce the environmental and social impact of litter at Arrochar, designated a 'litter sink' by the Scottish Government in 2017.\n\nCivTech is the world's first Government-run accelerator for digital public services. It was launched in 2016 to inject innovation into how the public sector uses technology to improve the lives of Scotland's citizens. At the heart of the programme is the Innovation Flow, which centres around an intense 15-week Accelerator. Innovative and ambitious teams or individuals, selected through an open and straightforward process, are paid to build working prototypes — and receive world-class business growth support.\n\nBusiness Minister Richard Lochhead said:\n\n\"Innovation is the backbone of our economy and our society. Where there are problems and challenges, there are solutions to be harnessed by tapping into the creativity and ingenuity of the start-up community and capitalising on rapidly-evolving technology such as AI.\n\n\"Now in its tenth year, CivTech has had a hugely positive impact on public sector services and beyond, with solutions ranging from a digital communication roll-out that could save the taxpayer £100 million a year, to products and services improving lives and prospects across healthcare, education and key front-line services.\n\n\"Success rates for the companies and products developed are very high with some 80% of the products created through the programme in use, far surpassing the average private sector accelerator rates. I look forward to another round of the programme continuing to revolutionise our public services while giving our brightest business minds the support and encouragement to develop their business ideas.\"\n\nMore information about all eight CivTech Round 11 Challenges can be found here.\n\nAbout CivTech\n\nLaunched in 2016, CivTech is the world's first Government-run accelerator for digital public services.\n\nAs of March 2024, of the teams participating in the Accelerators from CivTech 1 onwards, over 80% are currently operational. This survival rate is far higher than the private sector norm in which 20% of new businesses go under within 12 months, and 60% within three years.\n\nMore than 90% of the Accelerator companies have received follow-on contracts with their Challenge Sponsor. This compares very favourably with the typical private sector accelerator, in which just 20-30% of the teams go on to win further investment.\n\nCivTech companies have created over 400 well-paid jobs: the average salary stands at between £35,000 – £47,106 per year [from desktop research and as reported by companies respectively].\n\nAround 100 businesses have progressed through the Accelerator since its launch, with just over £25 million of public sector funding provided directly through CivTech contracts over its 10 rounds to date. This public funding has leveraged an additional £125 million in private investment.\n\nwww.civtech.scot",

This approach has helped create thousands of jobs in industries like cybersecurity in Northern Ireland and semiconductors in Wales, for example.\n\n\"To support the government's growth agenda, we must harness the power of local knowledge to build and further develop clusters of research and innovation-intensive companies. These will directly benefit communities, creating more jobs in emerging industries, developing local skills and attracting further investment.\"\n\nUK science and technology secretary Peter Kyle said: \"All across the UK there are incredible projects and fantastic innovation taking place. We know that these are critical for the UK's success.\n\n\"This fund now gives local leaders in every nation of the UK the chance to proudly capitalise on their city or region's expertise, from AI to life sciences, medicines to engineering, and beyond, to make a difference to lives across the country.\n\n\"With backing for more regions to come we can unlock the new jobs and business opportunities that are central to boosting the economic growth at the heart of our Plan for Change.\"\n\nPartnerships of local and city region authorities, businesses and research organisations will now work with UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) to invest the funding into regional and national priorities from early next year and could back a range of sectors, from life sciences to green energy solutions, AI to medical tech, and beyond.\n\nChief executive of Universities UK, Vivienne Stern, said: \"The Local Innovation Partnerships Fund will give regions the opportunity to set their own priorities, allowing them to amplify their strengths, boost innovation and growth.

      "description": "Abstract:As large language models (LLMs) advance, there is growing interest in using them to simulate human social behavior through generative agent-based modeling (GABM). However, validating these models remains a key challenge. We present a systematic two-stage validation approach using social dilemma paradigms from psychological literature, first identifying the cognitive components necessary for LLM agents to reproduce known human behaviors in mixed-motive settings from two landmark papers, then using the validated architecture to simulate novel conditions. Our model comparison of different cognitive architectures shows that both persona-based individual differences and theory of mind capabilities are essential for replicating third-party punishment (TPP) as a costly signal of trustworthiness. For the second study on public goods games, this architecture is able to replicate an increase in cooperation from the spread of reputational information through gossip. However, an additional strategic component is necessary to replicate the additional boost in cooperation rates in the condition that allows both ostracism and gossip. We then test novel predictions for each paper with our validated generative agents. We find that TPP rates significantly drop in settings where punishment is anonymous, yet a substantial amount of TPP persists, suggesting that both reputational and intrinsic moral motivations play a role in this behavior. For the second paper, we introduce a novel intervention and see that open discussion periods before rounds of the public goods game further increase contributions, allowing groups to develop social norms for cooperation. This work provides a framework for validating generative agent models while demonstrating their potential to generate novel and testable insights into human social behavior.",

      "description": "Abstract:Steganalysis methods based on deep learning (DL) often struggle with computational complexity and challenges in generalizing across different datasets. Incorporating a graph neural network (GNN) into steganalysis schemes enables the leveraging of relational data for improved detection accuracy and adaptability. This paper presents the first application of a Graph Neural Network (GNN), specifically the GraphSAGE architecture, for steganalysis of compressed voice over IP (VoIP) speech streams. The method involves straightforward graph construction from VoIP streams and employs GraphSAGE to capture hierarchical steganalysis information, including both fine grained details and high level patterns, thereby achieving high detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed approach performs well in uncovering quantization index modulation (QIM)-based steganographic patterns in VoIP signals. It achieves detection accuracy exceeding 98 percent even for short 0.5 second samples, and 95.17 percent accuracy under challenging conditions with low embedding rates, representing an improvement of 2.8 percent over the best performing state of the art methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits superior efficiency, with an average detection time as low as 0.016 seconds for 0.5-second samples an improvement of 0.003 seconds. This makes it efficient for online steganalysis tasks, providing a superior balance between detection accuracy and efficiency under the constraint of short samples with low embedding rates.",

      "description": "Abstract:Deepfakes powered by advanced machine learning models present a significant and evolving threat to identity verification and the authenticity of digital media. Although numerous detectors have been developed to address this problem, their effectiveness has yet to be tested when applied to real-world data. In this work we evaluate modern deepfake detectors, introducing a novel testing procedure designed to mimic real-world scenarios for deepfake detection. Using state-of-the-art deepfake generation methods, we create a comprehensive dataset containing more than 500,000 high-quality deepfake images. Our analysis shows that detecting deepfakes still remains a challenging task. The evaluation shows that in fewer than half of the deepfake detectors tested achieved an AUC score greater than 60%, with the lowest being 50%. We demonstrate that basic image manipulations, such as JPEG compression or image enhancement, can significantly reduce model performance. All code and data are publicly available at this https URL.",

      "description": "Abstract:Real-world fraud detection applications benefit from graph learning techniques that jointly exploit node features, often rich in textual data, and graph structural information. Recently, Graph-Enhanced LLMs emerge as a promising graph learning approach that converts graph information into prompts, exploiting LLMs' ability to reason over both textual and structural information. Among them, text-only prompting, which converts graph information to prompts consisting solely of text tokens, offers a solution that relies only on LLM tuning without requiring additional graph-specific encoders. However, text-only prompting struggles on heterogeneous fraud-detection graphs: multi-hop relations expand exponentially with each additional hop, leading to rapidly growing neighborhoods associated with dense textual information. These neighborhoods may overwhelm the model with long, irrelevant content in the prompt and suppress key signals from the target node, thereby degrading performance. To address this challenge, we propose Dual Granularity Prompting (DGP), which mitigates information overload by preserving fine-grained textual details for the target node while summarizing neighbor information into coarse-grained text prompts. DGP introduces tailored summarization strategies for different data modalities, bi-level semantic abstraction for textual fields and statistical aggregation for numerical features, enabling effective compression of verbose neighbor content into concise, informative prompts. Experiments across public and industrial datasets demonstrate that DGP operates within a manageable token budget while improving fraud detection performance by up to 6.8% (AUPRC) over state-of-the-art methods, showing the potential of Graph-Enhanced LLMs for fraud detection.",

By intent mediation, we refer to the fundamental process through which developers translate their conceptual goals into representations that computational systems can execute. Our results show that vibe coding reconfigures cognitive work by redistributing epistemic labor between humans and machines, shifting the expertise in the software development process away from traditional areas such as design or technical implementation toward collaborative orchestration.

The state-of-the-art solutions along this direction are based on generating natural language descriptions of the sensor data and feeding it via a carefully crafted prompt to the LLM to perform classification. Despite their performance guarantees, such ``prompt-the-LLM'' approaches carry several risks, including privacy invasion, reliance on an external service, and inconsistent predictions due to version changes, making a case for alternative zero-shot HAR methods that do not require prompting the LLMs. In this paper, we propose one such solution that models sensor data and activities using natural language, leveraging its embeddings to perform zero-shot classification and thereby bypassing the need to prompt the LLMs for activity predictions.

These reasoning failures frequently go undetected by standard NLP metrics, which are insensitive to latent representation shifts that drive diagnosis instability. We propose a geometry-aware evaluation framework, LAPD (Latent Agentic Perturbation Diagnostics), which systematically probes the latent robustness of clinical LLMs under structured adversarial edits. Within this framework, we introduce Latent Diagnosis Flip Rate (LDFR), a model-agnostic diagnostic signal that captures representational instability when embeddings cross decision boundaries in PCA-reduced latent space. Clinical notes are generated using a structured prompting pipeline grounded in diagnostic reasoning, then perturbed along four axes: masking, negation, synonym replacement, and numeric variation to simulate common ambiguities and omissions. We compute LDFR across both foundation and clinical LLMs, finding that latent fragility emerges even under minimal surface-level changes. Finally, we validate our findings on 90 real clinical notes from the DiReCT benchmark (MIMIC-IV), confirming the generalizability of LDFR beyond synthetic settings. Our results reveal a persistent gap between surface robustness and semantic stability, underscoring the importance of geometry-aware auditing in safety-critical clinical AI.",

      "description": "Abstract:Current AI systems rely on opaque reasoning processes that hinder human oversight and collaborative potential. Conventional explainable AI approaches offer post-hoc justifications and often fail to establish genuine symbiotic collaboration. In this paper, the Symbiotic Epistemology is presented as a philosophical foundation for human-AI cognitive partnerships. Unlike frameworks that treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions AI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human confidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and confidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as a formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is empirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's adaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive intervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for high-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations. It also integrates confidence quantification, declarative control over AI behavior, and context inheritance for multi-agent coordination. By structuring communication and embedding confidence-calibrated transparency, SynLang, together with symbiotic epistemology, enables AI systems that enhance human intelligence, preserve human agency, and uphold ethical accountability in collaborative decision-making. Through dual-level transparency, beginning with high-level reasoning patterns and progressing to granular explanations, the protocol facilitates rapid comprehension and supports thorough verification of AI decision-making.",

      "description": "The West faces a series of serious economic challenges: a demographic collapse that undermines growth; a welfare state that sucks money from the future and dispenses it in the present; a regulatory structure that focuses more on redistributionism and top-down control than on innovation. But, we are told, there is one enormous hope for the future of the global economy: artificial intelligence. AI will skyrocket economic productivity; it will provide us both information and innovation; it will solve insoluble problems and shrink timeframes to the infinitesimal. Marc Andreessen, investor extraordinaire, sums up the vision: \"We believe we are poised for an intelligence takeoff that will expand our capabilities to unimagined heights. We believe Artificial Intelligence is our alchemy, our Philosopher's Stone — we are literally making sand think.\"\n\nBy the available evidence, Andreessen is right: AI will be extraordinary. Already, AI can write better than most writers, think better than most professors and innovate better than most businesspeople. The question is: What comes next? For Andreessen, the answer is simple: whatever we want. \"Material abundance from markets and technology,\" he says, \"opens the space for religion, for politics, and for choices of how to live, socially and individually.\"",

      "description": "Abstract:An accurate initial heading angle is essential for efficient and safe navigation across diverse domains. Unlike magnetometers, gyroscopes can provide accurate heading reference independent of the magnetic disturbances in a process known as gyrocompassing. Yet, accurate and timely gyrocompassing, using low-cost gyroscopes, remains a significant challenge in scenarios where external navigation aids are unavailable. Such challenges are commonly addressed in real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, where size, weight, and power limitations restrict sensor quality, and noisy measurements severely degrade gyrocompassing performance. To cope with this challenge, we propose a novel diffusion denoiser-aided gyrocompass approach. It integrates a diffusion-based denoising framework with an enhanced learning-based heading estimation model. The diffusion denoiser processes raw inertial sensor signals before input to the deep learning model, resulting in accurate gyrocompassing. Experiments using both simulated and real sensor data demonstrate that our proposed approach improves gyrocompassing accuracy by 26% compared to model-based gyrocompassing and by 15% compared to other learning-driven approaches. This advancement holds particular significance for ensuring accurate and robust navigation in autonomous platforms that incorporate low-cost gyroscopes within their navigation systems.",

      "description": "By Akash Sriram and Zaheer Kachwala\n\n(Reuters) -Long seen as the safest Big Tech bet, Apple is heading into Thursday's earnings with its business facing pressure from U.S. tariffs, tough competition in China and a high-stakes artificial intelligence race it has been late to enter.\n\nWall Street expects the company to post a 4.2% rise in revenue for the April-June quarter to $89.34 billion. Still, the focus will be on how Apple plans to adjust to a landscape that has turned its global supply chain, long a strength, into a potential liability.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has targeted the consumer electronics giant for its reliance on overseas manufacturing, threatening 25% tariffs on foreign-made iPhones. To limit the damage, Apple shifted production of U.S.-bound iPhones to India, further drawing Trump's ire.\n\nThe total volume of Indian-made smartphones jumped 240% in the second quarter, largely driven by Apple's supply chain shift, according to research firm Canalys.\n\nAnalysts and investors are now expecting the strategy to help Apple limit the hit from tariffs to well below $900 million it had estimated in May.\n\nIPhones are \"a very high-profile product that both the Chinese and the U.S. governments understand they have a lever over,\" D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said. \"So until the tariff rates get settled, Apple is very much at risk of being impacted by the current trade dispute.\"\n\nAnalysts also said Apple, like many other firms, potentially overestimated tariff costs to leave room for an earnings beat.\n\n\"Most companies we follow have made conservative assumptions by overestimating tariff costs as the goal of management is generally to beat its own guidance,\" said Jamie Meyers, senior analyst at Apple shareholder Laffer Tengler Investments.\n\nSales of iPhones are expected to have risen 2.2% in Apple's fiscal third quarter, according to data compiled by LSEG, helped by an improvement in demand in China, Apple's third-largest market. In the fiscal second quarter, this increased 1.9%.\n\nCounterpoint Research data shows iPhone sales in the world's largest smartphone market jumped 8% in the quarter, fueled by steep discounts during the 618 shopping festival, government-backed trade-in subsidies and targeted iPhone 16 Pro promotions.\n\nSales of Apple's other devices are expected to have slowed in the April-June period, while revenue from services - its fastest-growing segment in recent years - is likely to rise to 10.7%. In the January-March period, services revenue grew 11.6%.\n\nDoubts still remain over Apple's prospects in China, where domestic companies including Honor are rolling out smartphones packed with AI features such as generative AI photo editors.\n\nApple's cautious approach to AI has fueled concerns it is sitting out what could be the industry's biggest growth wave in decades. The company was slow to roll out its Apple Intelligence suite, including a ChatGPT integration, while a long-awaited AI upgrade to Siri has been delayed until next year.",

While the overall number of organizations experiencing an AI-related breach is a small representation of the researched population, this is the first time security, governance and access controls for AI have been studied in this report, which suggests AI is already an easy, high value target.\n\n13% of organizations reported breaches of AI models or applications, while 8% of organizations reported not knowing if they had been compromised in this way.\nOf those compromised, 97% report not having AI access controls in place.\nAs a result, 60% of the AI-related security incidents led to compromised data and 31% led to operational disruption.\n\nThis year's results show that organizations are bypassing security and governance for AI in favor of do-it-now AI adoption. Ungoverned systems are more likely to be breached-and more costly when they are.\n\n\"The data shows that a gap between AI adoption and oversight already exists, and threat actors are starting to exploit it,\" said Suja Viswesan, Vice President, Security and Runtime Products, IBM. \"The report revealed a lack of basic access controls for AI systems, leaving highly sensitive data exposed, and models vulnerable to manipulation. As AI becomes more deeply embedded across business operations, AI security must be treated as foundational. The cost of inaction isn't just financial, it's the loss of trust, transparency and control.\"\n\nHowever, the report did reveal that organizations using AI and automation extensively throughout their security operations saved an average $1.9 million in breach costs and reduced the breach lifecycle by an average of 80 days.\n\nThe 2025 report, conducted by Ponemon Institute, sponsored and analyzed by IBM, is based on data breaches experienced by 600 organizations globally from March 2024 through February 2025. Key findings from the report around AI security and breaches, the financial cost of a breach, and operational disruption are as follows:\n\nBreaches and the AI era\n\nAI Governance Policies. 63% of breached organizations either don't have an AI governance policy or are still developing a policy. Of the organizations that have AI governance policies in place, only 34% perform regular audits for unsanctioned AI.\nThe Cost of Shadow AI. One in five organizations reported a breach due to shadow AI, and only 37% have policies to manage AI or detect shadow AI. Organizations that used high levels of shadow AI observed an average of $670,000 in higher breach costs than those with a low level or no shadow AI. Security incidents involving shadow AI led to more personally identifiable information (65%) and intellectual property (40%) being compromised compared to the global average (53% and 33% respectively).\nSmarter Attacks with AI. 16% of breaches studied involved attackers using AI tools, most often for phishing or deepfake impersonation attacks.\n\nThe Financial Cost of a Breach\n\nData Breach Costs. The global average cost of a data breach fell to $4.44 million, the first decline in five years, while the average U.S. cost of a breach reached a record $10.22 million.\nGlobal Breach Lifecycles Hit Record Low. The global average breach lifecycle (the mean time to identify and contain a breach, including restore services) dropped to 241 days, a 17-day reduction from the year prior, as more studied organizations detected the breach internally. Those organizations who detected the breach internally also observed a $900,000 savings on breach costs compared to those disclosed by an attacker.\nHealthcare Breaches Remain the Costliest. Averaging $7.42 million, healthcare breaches remained the most expensive across all studied industries, even as this sector saw a $2.35 million reduction in costs compared to 2024. Breaches across this sector take the longest to identify and contain at 279 days, that's more than 5 weeks longer than the global average of 241 days.\nRansom Payment Fatigue. Last year, organizations pushed back against ransom demands, with more opting not to pay (63%) compared to the year prior (59%). As more organizations refuse to pay ransoms, the average cost of an extortion or ransomware incident remains high, particularly when disclosed by an attacker ($5.08 million).\nSecurity Investments Stall Amid Rising AI Risks. There was a significant reduction in the number of organizations that said they plan to invest in security following a breach, 49% in 2025 compared to 63% in 2024. Less than half of those that plan to invest in security post-breach will focus on AI-driven security solutions or services.\n\nThe Long Tail of a Breach: Operational Disruption\n\nAccording to the 2025 IBM report, nearly all organizations studied suffered operational disruption following a data breach. This level of disruption is taking a toll on recovery timelines. Among organizations that reported recovery, most took more than 100 days on average to do so.\n\nHowever, the consequences of a breach continue to extend beyond containment. While down compared to the year prior, nearly half of all organizations reported that they planned to raise the price of goods or services because of the breach, and nearly one-third reported price increases of 15% or more.\n\n  the Cost of a Data Breach Report\n\nThe Cost of a Data Breach Report has investigated nearly 6,500 data breaches over the past 20 years. Since the inaugural report in 2005, the nature of breaches has evolved dramatically. Back then, risk was largely physical. Today, the threat landscape is overwhelmingly digital and increasingly targeted, with breaches now driven by a spectrum of malicious activity.\n\nWith the pace of enterprise AI adoption proliferating, for the first time, the Cost of a Data Breach research studied the state of security and governance for AI, the type of data targeted in security incidents involving AI, breach costs associated with AI-driven attacks, and the prevalence and risk profile of shadow AI (unregulated, unauthorized use of AI). Historical findings from past reports include the following:\n\n2005: nearly half (45%) of all data breaches were caused by lost or stolen computing devices, such as a laptop or thumb drive, and only 10% of breaches were due to hacked electronic systems.\n2015: breaches due to cloud misconfiguration weren't even a categorized threat, today they are a leading target.\n2020: ransomware began to surge, and by 2021 it accounted for an average of $4.62 million in breach costs, and this year that number reached an average of $5.08 million (when the incident was disclosed by an attacker).\n2025: AI, which was included for the first time in the research this year, is quickly emerging as a high value target.\n\nAdditional sources:\n\nDownload a copy of the 2025 Cost of a Data Breach Report to learn more.\nSign up for the 2025 IBM Cost of a Data Breach webinar on Wednesday, August 13, 2025, at 11:00 a.m. ET.\nRead more about the report's top findings in this IBM blog.\n\n  IBM\nIBM is a leading provider of global hybrid cloud and AI, and consulting expertise.

      "description": "Need to Modernize to Meet Power and Density Requirements Remains Strong\n\nNEW YORK, July 30, 2025 BUSINESS WIRE Uptime Institute today announced the release of its 15th Annual Global Data Center Survey 2025 revealing an innovative and resilient industry – one that is also facing rising costs, worsening power constraints, and challenges in meeting the demands for AI. As operators expand and modernize to meet power and density requirements, they must address availability, efficiency, staffing challenges, supply chain delays, and unpredictable technological advances.\n\n\"Our data shows operators are tasked with managing a lot of big strategic challenges at the same time. These include anticipating multiple technological changes, planning for expansion in spite of major constraints on power availability, and preparing for and supporting unpredictable AI workload demand,\" said Andy Lawrence, Executive Director of Research, Uptime Institute. \"This is a time where senior level experience is critical. But for the first time, more operators are finding it harder to recruit and retain senior people than people at an earlier stage of their career. There is a management shortage, with many experienced leaders retiring just as another phase of dramatic growth gets underway.\"\n\nRoughly one-third of data center owners and operators currently perform some AI training or inference, and a significantly greater proportion plan to do so in the future. But much of this is early stage and cautious. Uncertainty over the appropriate or likely venues for AI workloads, and apprehension over the power demands of projected NVIDIA GPU systems, is likely contributing to capacity concerns.\n\nNow in its 15th year, Uptime Institute's annual survey is the most comprehensive and longest-running study of its kind. The findings of this report highlight the practices and experiences of data center owners and operators in the areas of resiliency, sustainability, efficiency, staffing, cloud, and artificial intelligence.\n\nKey findings from the 2025 report include:\n\nCost issues remain the top concern for digital infrastructure management teams in 2025 — but worries around forecasting future capacity requirements have grown significantly.\n\nAverage PUE levels show little change for the sixth consecutive year, with improvements constrained by legacy infrastructure and some climate specific limitations to efficient cooling.\n\nAverage server rack power densities continue to rise, with greater adoption of racks in the 10–30 kW range. Few facilities exceed 30 kW, and extreme densities are as yet rare.\n\nThe collection and reporting of key sustainability metrics have not improved in 2025, which is likely due in part to commercial pressures to support AI, and easing regulatory pressure in some regions.\n\nTrust in AI for data center operations depends on the use case: most would allow its use for analyzing sensor data and predictive maintenance tasks, but not configuration changes, controlling equipment, or staffing issues.\n\nImpactful data center outages are gradually becoming less frequent — but one in ten still cause serious or severe disruption, underscoring the need for continued investment.\n\nEnterprises continue to adopt hybrid IT strategies, spanning cloud, colocation on-premises data centers. On-premises data centers remain foundational for those with large, mission critical processing needs, with 45% of IT workloads still residing in corporate facilities.\n\nStaffing challenges persist in 2025. Nearly two-thirds of operators report difficulty retaining staff, finding qualified candidates, or both.\n\nAbout the Survey:\n\nUptime conducted this year's Annual Global Data Center Survey online and via email from April to May 2025 and collected responses from more than 800 data center owners and operators. For the third consecutive year, Uptime's survey asked data center operators to identify their management team's top concerns related to digital infrastructure. In 2025, new response options were added to reflect the evolving challenges surrounding power availability, supply chain disruptions, and demand for AI.\n\nThe survey participants represent a wide range of industry verticals in multiple countries. Nearly half (43%) are located in North America and Europe. Approximately one in five respondents work for professional IT / data center service providers — that is, staff with operational or executive responsibilities for a third-party data center, such as those offering colocation, wholesale, software, or cloud computing services.\n\nLearn More:\n\nDownload the executive summary report here and register for the webinar here covering key trends and takeaways from the survey results on July 30th at 9:00 AM PDT (9:00 AM PDT, 12:00 PM EDT, and 5:00 PM BST).

The increase in net sales also</p> <p>reflects tariff-related price adjustments in North America.</p> <p> Gross profit for the second quarter of 2025 was $120.1 million</p> <p>compared with $113.2 million in the prior-year period. The increase</p> <p>in gross profit for the quarter was primarily driven by higher net</p> <p>sales in the Company's fresh and value-added products segment,</p> <p>partially offset by higher per unit production and procurement</p> <p>costs, as well as higher distribution costs, including the impact</p> <p>of tariff-related charges in North America. Gross margin for the</p> <p>second quarter of 2025 increased to 10.2% compared with 9.9% in the</p> <p>prior-year period.</p> <p> Adjusted gross profit for the second quarter of</p> <p>2025 was $120.1 million compared with $114.4 million in the</p> <p>prior-year period. Adjusted gross profit for the second quarter of</p> <p>2024 included $1.2 million of other product-related charges,</p> <p>primarily related to shipment disruptions in the Red Sea and</p> <p>clean-up costs associated with the flooding of a seasonal</p> <p>production facility in Greece during 2023. No other product-related</p> <p>charges were recorded during the second quarter of 2025.</p> <p> Operating income for the second quarter of 2025 was $68.3</p> <p>million compared with $68.2 million in the prior-year period. The</p> <p>increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher gross</p> <p>profit, partially offset by a lower gain on disposal of property,</p> <p>plant and equipment, net, in the current year period.</p> <p> Adjusted operating income for the second quarter</p> <p>of 2025 was $68.8 million compared with $64.5 million in the</p> <p>prior-year period. Adjusted operating income for the second quarter</p> <p>of 2025 excluded an impairment charge related to a leased farm in</p> <p>Chile. In the prior-year period, Adjusted operating income,</p> <p>primarily excluded the above mentioned other product related</p> <p>charges, a $3.4 million gain on asset sale of a European warehouse</p> <p>and $2.0 million of insurance recoveries associated with fire</p> <p>damage to a warehouse facility in South America during 2023,</p> <p>partially offset by impairment charges of banana-related fixed</p> <p>assets in the Philippines.</p> <p> Other (income) expense, net, for the second quarter of 2025 was</p> <p>a gain of $6.2 million compared with a gain of $2.3 million in the</p> <p>prior-year period. The change was primarily due to equity earnings</p> <p>from unconsolidated companies within the food and nutrition</p> <p>sector.</p> <p> FDP net income for the second quarter of 2025 was</p> <p>$56.8 million compared with $53.6 million in the prior-year period</p> <p>and Adjusted FDP net income was $59.1 million</p> <p>compared with $50.9 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted FDP</p> <p>net income for both periods excludes the above-mentioned</p> <p>adjustments and the tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments.</p> <p> Second Quarter 2025 Business Segment Performance and Selected</p> <p>Financial Data (As reported in business segment data)</p> <p> Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc.</p> <p>and Subsidiaries</p> <p> Business Segment Data</p> <p> (U.S. dollars in millions) -</p> <p>(Unaudited)</p> <p> Quarter ended</p> <p> June 27, 2025</p> <p> June 28, 2024</p> <p> Segment Data:</p> <p> Net Sales</p> <p> Gross Profit</p> <p> Gross</p> <p> Margin</p> <p> Net Sales</p> <p> Gross Profit</p> <p> Gross</p> <p> Margin</p> <p> Fresh and value-added products</p> <p> Banana</p> <p> Other products and services</p> <p> Six months ended</p> <p> June 27, 2025</p> <p> June 28, 2024</p> <p> Net Sales</p> <p> Gross Profit</p> <p> Gross</p> <p> Margin</p> <p> Net Sales</p> <p> Gross Profit</p> <p> Gross</p> <p> Margin</p> <p> Fresh and value-added products</p> <p> Banana</p> <p> Other products and services</p> <p> Non-GAAP financial measure.</p> <p>Reconciliations and other information required by Regulation G can</p> <p>be found below under \"Non-GAAP Measures.\"</p> <p> \"FDP net income\" as referenced throughout</p> <p>this release is defined as Net income attributable to Fresh Del</p> <p>Monte Produce Inc.</p> <p> Second Quarter 2025 Business Segment Performance</p> <p> Fresh and Value-Added</p> <p>Products</p> <p> Net sales for the second quarter of 2025 were $722.6</p> <p>million compared with $694.1 million in the prior-year period. The</p> <p>increase in net sales was primarily a result of higher per unit</p> <p>selling prices in the Company's pineapple product line, higher</p> <p>sales volume and per unit selling prices in it's fresh-cut fruit</p> <p>product line due to strong market demand, the favorable impact of</p> <p>fluctuations in exchange rates, primarily related to the British</p> <p>pound, Euro and Japanese yen, and tariff-related price adjustments</p> <p>in North America. The increase was partially offset by lower net</p> <p>sales in the Company's fresh-cut vegetable and vegetable product</p> <p>lines due to strategic operational reductions during the fourth</p> <p>quarter of 2024, which included the sale of certain assets of Fresh</p> <p>Leaf Farms.</p> <p> Gross profit for the second quarter of 2025 was $84.9</p> <p>million compared with $77.9 million in the prior-year period. The</p> <p>increase in gross profit was primarily driven by higher net sales,</p> <p>partially offset by higher per unit production and procurement</p> <p>costs, as well as increased distribution costs, including the</p> <p>impact of tariff-related charges in North America. Gross margin</p> <p>increased to 11.7% compared with 11.2% in the prior-year</p> <p>period.</p> <p> Banana</p> <p> Net sales for the second quarter of 2025 were $410.0</p> <p>million compared with $394.3 million in the prior-year period. The</p> <p>increase in net sales was primarily driven by higher per unit</p> <p>selling prices across all of the Company's regions, combined with</p> <p>the favorable impact of fluctuations in exchange rates, primarily</p> <p>related to the Euro, and tariff-related price adjustments in North</p> <p>America. Sales volume increased in the Middle East, reflecting a</p> <p>recovery from the prior-year shipment disruptions caused by the Red</p> <p>Sea conflict. These gains were partially offset by lower sales</p> <p>volume in Asia and North America.</p> <p> Gross profit for the second quarter of 2025 was $30.0</p> <p>million compared with $29.8 million in the prior-year period. The</p> <p>slight increase in gross profit reflects the benefit of higher net</p> <p>sales, partially offset by higher per unit production and</p> <p>procurement costs resulting from adverse weather conditions in the</p> <p>Company's growing regions and higher distribution costs, including</p> <p>the impact of tariff-related charges in North America. Gross margin</p> <p>decreased to 7.3% compared with 7.6% in the prior-year period.</p> <p> Other Products and</p> <p>Services</p> <p> Net sales for the second quarter of 2025 were $49.9</p> <p>million, compared with $51.3 million in the prior-year period. The</p> <p>decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower net sales in the</p> <p>Company's poultry and meats business due to lower per unit selling</p> <p>prices.</p> <p> Gross profit for the second quarter of 2025 was $5.2</p> <p>million compared with $5.5 million in the prior-year period. The</p> <p>decrease in gross profit was primarily a result of lower net sales</p> <p>in the Company's poultry and meats business. Gross margin decreased</p> <p>to 10.4% compared with 10.7% in the prior-year period.</p> <p> Cash Flows</p> <p> Net cash provided by operating activities for the first six</p> <p>months of 2025 was $159.2 million compared with $143.7 million in</p> <p>the prior-year period. The increase in net cash provided by</p> <p>operating activities was primarily attributable to higher net</p> <p>income and working capital fluctuations, mainly driven by higher</p> <p>levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses, as a result of the</p> <p>timing of period end payments to suppliers. The increase was</p> <p>partially offset by higher levels of inventory when compared to the</p> <p>prior-year period.</p> <p> Long Term Debt</p> <p> Long-term debt decreased to $201.0 million at the end of the</p> <p>second quarter of 2025, an $84 million or 29% reduction from $285.0</p> <p>million at the end of the second quarter of 2024.</p> <p> Quarterly Cash Dividend</p> <p> On July 29, 2025, the Company's Board of Directors declared a</p> <p>quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share, payable on September 5,</p> <p>2025, to shareholders of record on August 13, 2025.</p> <p> Share Repurchase Program</p> <p> During the second quarter of 2025, the Company did not</p> <p>repurchase shares as part of the $150.0 million share repurchase</p> <p>program.

<p>generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Certain</p> <p>information presented in this press release reflects adjustments to</p> <p>GAAP measures that are referred to in this press release as</p> <p>\"non-GAAP measures.\" Management believes these non-GAAP measures</p> <p>provide a more comparable analysis of the underlying operating</p> <p>performance of the business.</p> <p> These non-GAAP measures include the following: Adjusted gross</p> <p>profit, Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted operating income, Adjusted</p> <p>FDP net income, Adjusted diluted EPS, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,</p> <p>EBITDA margin, and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Adjusted gross profit,</p> <p>Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted operating income, Adjusted FDP net</p> <p>income and Adjusted diluted EPS each reflect adjustments relating</p> <p>to asset impairment and other charges (credits), net, gain on</p> <p>disposal of property, plant and equipment, net and other</p> <p>product-related (credits) charges. EBITDA is defined as net income</p> <p>attributable to Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. excluding interest</p> <p>expense, net, provision for income taxes, depreciation and</p> <p>amortization, and share-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA</p> <p>represents EBITDA with additional adjustments for asset impairment</p> <p>and other charges (credits), net, gain on disposal of property,</p> <p>plant and equipment, net, and other product-related (credits)</p> <p>charges. EBITDA margin represents EBITDA as a percentage of net</p> <p>sales, and Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a</p> <p>percentage of net sales.</p> <p> These non-GAAP measures provide the Company with an</p> <p>understanding of the results from the primary operations of its</p> <p>business. The Company uses these metrics because management</p> <p>believes they provide more comparable measures to evaluate</p> <p>period-over-period operating performance since they exclude special</p> <p>items that are not indicative of the Company's core business or</p> <p>operations. These measures may be useful to an investor in</p> <p>evaluating the underlying operating performance of the Company's</p> <p>business because these measures:</p> <p> Are used by investors to measure a company's comparable</p> <p>operating performance;</p> <p> Are financial measurements that are used by lenders and other</p> <p>parties to evaluate creditworthiness; and</p> <p> Are used by the Company's management for various purposes,</p> <p>including as measures of performance of its operating entities, as</p> <p>a basis of strategic planning and forecasting, and in certain cases</p> <p>as a basis for incentive compensation.</p> <p> Because all companies do not use identical calculations, the</p> <p>Company's presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures may not</p> <p>be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.</p> <p>Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly</p> <p>comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the financial</p> <p>tables that accompany this release.</p> <p> Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc.</p> <p>and Subsidiaries</p> <p> Non-GAAP</p> <p>Reconciliation</p> <p> (U.S. dollars in millions,</p> <p>except per-share amounts) - (Unaudited)</p> <p> Quarter ended</p> <p> June 27,</p> <p> June 28,</p> <p> Gross</p> <p> profit</p> <p> Operating</p> <p> income</p> <p> Net income</p> <p> attributable</p> <p> to Fresh</p> <p> Del Monte</p> <p> Produce</p> <p> Inc.</p> <p> Diluted EPS</p> <p> Gross</p> <p> profit</p> <p> Operating</p> <p> income</p> <p> Net income</p> <p> attributable</p> <p> to Fresh</p> <p> Del Monte</p> <p> Produce</p> <p> Inc.</p> <p> Diluted EPS</p> <p> As reported</p> <p> Adjustments:</p> <p> Other product-related charges</p> <p> —</p> <p> —</p> <p> —</p> <p> —</p> <p> Asset impairment and other charges</p> <p>(credits), net</p> <p> —</p> <p> —</p> <p> Gain on disposal of property, plant and</p> <p>equipment, net</p> <p> —</p> <p> —</p> <p> —</p> <p> Tax effects of all adjustments</p> <p> —</p> <p> —</p> <p> —</p> <p> —</p> <p> As adjusted</p> <p> Six months ended</p> <p> June 27,</p> <p> June 28,</p> <p> Gross</p> <p> profit</p> <p> Operating</p> <p> income</p> <p> Net income</p> <p> attributable</p> <p> to Fresh</p> <p> Del Monte</p> <p> Produce</p> <p> Inc.</p> <p> Diluted EPS</p> <p> Gross</p> <p> profit</p> <p> Operating</p> <p> income</p> <p> Net income</p> <p> attributable</p> <p> to Fresh</p> <p> Del Monte</p> <p> Produce</p> <p> Inc.</p> <p> Diluted EPS</p> <p> As reported</p> <p> Adjustments:</p> <p> Other product-related charges</p> <p> —</p> <p> —</p> <p> —</p> <p> —</p> <p> —</p> <p> Asset impairment and other charges</p> <p>(credits), net</p> <p> —</p> <p> —</p> <p> Gain on disposal of property, plant and</p> <p>equipment, net</p> <p> —</p> <p> —</p> <p> Tax effects of all adjustments</p> <p> —</p> <p> —</p> <p> —</p> <p> —</p> <p> As adjusted</p> <p> Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc.</p> <p>and Subsidiaries</p> <p> Segment Gross Profit Non-GAAP</p> <p>Reconciliation</p> <p> (U.S. dollars in millions) -</p> <p>(Unaudited)</p> <p> Quarter ended</p> <p> June 27,</p> <p> June 28,</p> <p> Fresh and</p> <p> value-</p> <p> added</p> <p> products</p> <p> Banana</p> <p> Other</p> <p> products</p> <p> and</p> <p> services</p> <p> Total</p> <p> Fresh and</p> <p> value-</p> <p> added</p> <p> products</p> <p> Banana</p> <p> Other</p> <p> products</p> <p> and</p> <p> services</p> <p> Total</p> <p> Gross profit (as reported)</p> <p> Adjustments:</p> <p> Other product-related charges</p> <p> —</p> <p> —</p> <p> —</p> <p> —</p> <p> —</p> <p> —</p> <p> Adjusted gross profit</p> <p> Net Sales</p> <p> Gross margin (a)</p> <p> Adjusted gross margin (b)</p> <p> Six months ended</p> <p> June 27,</p> <p> June 28,</p> <p> Fresh and</p> <p> value-</p> <p> added</p> <p> products</p> <p> Banana</p> <p> Other</p> <p> products</p> <p> and</p> <p> services</p> <p> Total</p> <p> Fresh and</p> <p> value-</p> <p> added</p> <p> products</p> <p> Banana</p> <p> Other</p> <p> products</p> <p> and</p> <p> services</p> <p> Total</p> <p> Gross profit (as reported)</p> <p> Adjustments:</p> <p> Other product-related charges</p> <p> —</p> <p> —</p> <p> —</p> <p> —</p> <p> —</p> <p> —</p> <p> Adjusted Gross profit</p> <p> Net Sales</p> <p> Gross margin (a)</p> <p> Adjusted Gross margin (b)</p> <p> (a)</p> <p> Calculated as Gross profit as a</p> <p>percentage of net sales.</p> <p> (b)</p> <p> Calculated as Adjusted Gross profit as</p> <p>a percentage of net sales.</p> <p> Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc.</p> <p>and Subsidiaries</p> <p> Reconciliation of EBITDA and</p> <p>Adjusted EBITDA</p> <p> (U.S. dollars in millions) -</p> <p>(Unaudited)</p> <p> Quarter ended</p> <p> Six months ended</p> <p> June 27,</p> <p> June 28,</p> <p> June 27,</p> <p> June 28,</p> <p> Net income attributable to Fresh Del Monte</p> <p>Produce Inc.</p> <p> Interest expense, net</p> <p> Income tax provision</p> <p> Depreciation &amp;

Richard discovers how Mortgage Advice Bureau is setting out to disrupt its industry. <p> Of the nine companies to publish annual reports and pass the minimum quality filter since my last update , three have more than decent track records.</p> <p> 5 Strikes</p> <p> Polar Capital [- Growth] is a fund manager. It has only one strike for turnover growth because turnover has fallen by more than 10% in four of the last eleven years.</p> <p> Volatility is an occupational hazard for fund managers, even ones like Polar Capital that claim to create their own path , because their fortunes are dependent on stock markets.</p> <p> Because traders buy shares in fund managers in bull markets and sell them in bear markets their share prices are usually even more volatile than the performance of the markets they invest in.</p> <p> Volatility and scepticism about how much value fund managers create are the reason I invest mostly in shares, not funds. I don't find investing in management companies very appealing either.</p> <p> Name</p> <p> TIDM</p> <p> Prev AR</p> <p> Holdings (%)</p> <p> Strikes</p> <p> # Strikes</p> <p> Celebrus Technologies</p> <p> CLBS</p> <p> – Holdings – CROCI – Growth ?

Principally, it makes sure there is enough money in corporate and public sector schemes and provides them with investment advice.</p> <p> Source: Sharescope &gt; Financials &gt; Company &gt; Activity Breakdown</p> <p> Generally, XPS has operated with a high net debt to capital ratio since it floated in 2017, but since it is a people business, this is probably because of the low amount of capital required to operate, not excessive financial obligations.</p> <p> MS International [- CROCI – ROCE] is a mini manufacturing conglomerate. In recent years, new orders for the company's defence division, which makes naval cannon and counter-drone land-based weapons systems, have transformed profitability and led the board to consider divesting other businesses, which make forks for forklift trucks, superstructures for petrol stations, and petrol station branding.</p> <p> The defence orders are lumpy, though. In the annual report, MSI moderates expectations, saying government reviews and delayed decisions are likely to impact the year to April 2026.</p> <p> Mortgage Advice Bureau – the zig</p> <p> In my last article, I described Mortgage Advice Bureau as a company that zigs when others zag because it is investing in its own technology platform, unlike it claims, unlike its rivals.</p> <p> Having watched back the company's presentation (originally presented to analysts last February), I have learned more about the zig.</p> <p> MAB operates a network of nearly 200 mortgage advisory firms (aka Appointed Representatives or AR firms). It generates custom for them through partnerships with estate agents, builders and price comparison sites, provides regulatory oversight, training, administrative support, and access to its brokerage platform.</p> <p> MAB earns revenue from lenders who pay a fee each time the network procures a mortgage (40% of revenue) through its platform. It earns revenue from commissions from insurance companies (39% of revenue), and client fees from you and me when we mortgage (19% of revenue). It keeps about 30% of the revenue and distributes the remainder to the AR firms.</p> <p> It also partially or wholly owns 12 firms. These, it says, are larger and more productive than the AR firms in the network. They are more profitable, contributing half of adjusted profit in 2024 from less than half of revenue:</p> <p> Source: MAB capital markets day presentation, February 2025</p> <p> One of the reasons given for the success of the invested business at the capital markets day was that they are more tech \"savvy\" than the AR firms.</p> <p> MAB has long used technology to help advisers find mortgages for clients in an efficient and compliant way. MAB 2.0, the zig, extends the company's capabilities from facilitating transactions to nurturing and retaining clients, while promising more efficiency gains.</p> <p> The MAB platform allows advisers to engage with clients before they are ready to mortgage and stay with them until they are ready to remortgage. For example, MAB has introduced Mortgage Monitor , a service anyone can sign up for. It scans the market and sends monthly reports and alerts when a new mortgage deal might be beneficial.</p> <p> MAB expects the new platform to halve the time it takes to arrange a mortgage from 10 hours to 5 hours through automation and customer self-service. It reckons a dash of coming AI enhancements will get that number down to 2 hours. It even demonstrated an AI advisor avatar conversing with a client.</p> <p> Barring the avatar, the features did not overwhelm me with their originality. The Mortgage Monitor might have been modelled on the way the bank updates me on my credit score each month, or the way price comparison sites keep us informed of better energy tariffs.</p> <p> But according to MAB, this level of sophistication does not exist in the fragmented world of Mortgage advice and, somewhat reassuringly, MAB says nearly 90% of residential mortgage transactions (excluding product transfers) are facilitated by intermediaries like MAB. Product transfers happen when we remortgage to another product from the same lender. About half of these are advised to.</p> <p> MAB not only says it has a first mover advantage in an industry it believes is destined to be disrupted by technology, but it says none of its peers are in a hurry to follow. As for new entrants, they would need capabilities not just in technology but compliance and the sourcing of clients.</p> <p> That's the essence of MAB's pitch last February. I thought it was a good one. However, rapid change in an industry can be unsettling even for early movers. Google wasn't the first search engine.</p> <p> Putting together the facts that invested businesses are both more productive and do more with the technology raises the question of how willingly advisers will adopt AI. The question was asked at the end of the presentation and the reply was, to paraphrase, people generally don't like change, but advisers \"get it\" (\"it\" being AI is an enabling technology). Perhaps they are more likely to get it if you run the business, and that is driving MAB's appetite for acquisitions.</p> <p> Then there is the, to my mind, dystopian mortgage market. MAB expects the market to grow. Our mortgage had a term of 25 years, which we were very pleased to pay off early. But thirty-year and 35-year mortgages are growing in popularity because houses are so expensive. Remortgages later in life to pay off interest-only mortgages, and fund retirement and the \"Bank of Mum and Dad\", are also more popular.</p> <p> This vision of permanent debt may be attractive to mortgage advisers and their robot successors, but I don't think it is good for the rest of us.</p> <p> Nevertheless, people like to use advisers, and MAB passed the 5 Strikes process easily, so it has been a strong business. I like businesses that invest from a position of strength as much as I like businesses that zig when others zag!</p> <p> MAB published a half-year trading update last week. Business appears to be brisk.</p> <p> ~</p> <p> Contact Richard Beddard by email: richard@beddard.net , Twitter: @RichardBeddard , web: beddard.net</p> <p> This article is for educational purposes only.

If April is the cruellest month, August is the most chaotic, with a truly unhinged number of festivals hitting Edinburgh and, to a lesser but still important extent, the rest of the country. And we have, as usual, made our biggest issue yet, packed with interviews, previews and reviews to whet your appetite.\n\nObviously, there is the Fringe (an understatement if ever there were one): we chat with the folks behind Welcome to the Fringe, Palestine, a programme of Palestinian theatre, music and workshops at Portobello Town Hall; we also (and by we I mean our theatre editor Rho) rail against AI, and consider the shows that use technology in a materially interesting way. And then there's all the other festivals: Books chats with folks from Book Fringe; Simone Seales and Mele Broomes appearing at Edinburgh Book Festival; and Chris McQueer at Govanhill International Festival (go Glasgow!).\n\nThere's also chat about what alternative comedy means, and an interview with comedians doing a sober Fringe. Music interviews Billy Nomates ahead of their appearance at Fringe By the Sea, Art looks at Art Festival offerings by Wael Shawky and Jonathan Baldock amongst others, and Film gives us some top picks from EIFF. All that and so, so much more in the latest issue, pick it up in all the usual spots and happy festival-ing.\n\nThese are our regular distribution locations; copies make their way around Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dundee in the first week of the month.

      "description": "Artificial intelligence audience testing startup Artificial Societies Ltd. today launched its flagship \"societal simulator\" tool in order to speed up market research.\n\nThe Artificial Collective Intelligence or ACI platform is designed to understand social dynamics and accurately predict trends, so that businesses and creators can test how specific target audiences might respond to new products, messaging, social media campaigns and branding initiatives before they're launched.\n\nUsing the ACI platform, businesses can create \"artificial societies,\" or digital simulations of a particular target group, based on demographics, gender, location and other parameters. Each artificial society is represented by AI-powered \"personas,\" which attempt to mirror the traits, preferences and behaviors of different audiences.\n\nThe AI personas are based on real-world data collected from various social media channels, trained and then refined with a behavioral analysis engine, which tries to predict how people with certain characteristics and traits might react to different types of content. It takes into account their likely motivations and decision-triggers.\n\nArtificial Societies said the ACI platform aims to provide a faster and more affordable alternative to traditional market research, which is a $100 billion-plus industry. It has developed more than 500,000 AI personas, and each society it generates will contain between 20 and 300. These societies can be used to test how messages, ideas and concepts resonate with a specified target audience. For instance, if a company is planning to run a new ad campaign or promotion, it can test it on an AI society first, to ensure it's going to have the desired impact.\n\nIn each simulation, the ACI platform will generate 10 alternate content variations, so businesses can experiment and see how different versions perform.\n\nThe startup cites an internal study that shows how its platform has demonstrated an accuracy of more than 80% in terms of predicting social media performance. That compares well with some of the leading large language models, such as Anthropic PBC's Claude Sonnet 3.7, which scored 67% on the same tests, Google LLC's Gemini Pro 1.5, which scored 64%, and OpenAI's GPT-4o, which achieved 60% accuracy.\n\nThough 80% is by no means perfect, Artificial Societies co-founder and Chief Executive James He says it's good enough for most marketers, giving them a reliable way to test and launch top-performing content without spending a fortune on traditional market research.\n\n\"Our AI-driven marketing simulator is designed to empower users with enterprise-grade AI tools that truly expand human potential rather than replace it,\" He said. \"From seasoned professionals to first-time content creators, this is more than a product offering, it's open access to understanding markets and audience sentiment.\"\n\nConstellation Research Inc. analyst Liz Miller said Artificial Societies illustrates how AI is increasingly helping to automate marketing operations, but she warned that marketers should not consider it as a replacement for traditional market research. Though it's probably quite useful in terms of helping to quickly gauge how an audience might react to a new promotion or product launch, for example, the problem is there are no guarantees that it will actually reflect the thoughts and perspectives of real humans, she said. After all, artificial societies are not real societies.\n\n\"The recommendation here is to consider a layered approach that doesn't necessarily demand the deployment of traditional market research methods,\" Miller said. \"Consider a blend of real-time human feedback via platforms like UserTesting that can deploy qualitative and quantitative panels quickly and cost effectively, in addition to simulator approaches like AI Society Simulator. In this age of AI there really is no reason customer voices can't be tested and gathered through multiple means. This becomes another tool in the testing kit.\"\n\nArtificial Societies said the ACI platform is available now for anyone to try, with three free credits – meaning three simulations – for nonsubscribers. For $40 per month, users can run as many simulations as they like, while larger enterprises can pay more to access additional features such as custom audiences based on their own data.",

This represents a 10.4% increase from CA$6.32 million in 2024, reflecting the growing financial impact of security incidents. Among the report's findings is the rise of unsanctioned AI– known as Shadow AI – which amplify risks, escalate costs, and expose sensitive consumer data. Often introduced by employees using unapproved AI systems, shadow AI creates vulnerabilities and compliance issues for businesses.\n\nThe report emphasizes the critical role of security AI and automation in reducing breach costs and improving detection efficiency. Organizations extensively using security AI and autonomation report average breach costs of CA$5.19 million, compared to CA$8.53 million for those not using these tools. Additionally, these technologies helped organizations achieve faster detection and containment, shortening breach lifecycles by 59 days for those using them extensively.\n\n\"Cybersecurity isn't just about protecting data — it is about protecting your business's bottom line and reputation,\" said Daina Proctor, Security Delivery Leader, IBM Canada. \"This report shows that organizations using AI and automation are saving millions and detecting breaches much faster, but gaps in AI security and governance, like the use of shadow AI, are leaving businesses exposed to unnecessary risks. By investing in AI tools and building clear AI policies, companies can take control of their security and stay ahead of emerging threats.\"\n\nKey Findings in Canada for 2025\n\nOverexposed AI: One in three Canadian businesses reported not having access controls on AI systems, positioning them as easy, high-value targets.\nShadow AI Risks: The use of shadow AI was also found to be a top breach cost driver for Canadian businesses, with breaches involving shadow AI increasing costs by $308,000.\nPhishing Scams: The most common initial attack vector, phishing scams cost Canadian organizations an average of CA$7.91 million per breach, a 24% increase from CA$6.38 million in 2024.\nIndustry Impacts:\n\nThe financial sector leads breach costs at CA$9.97 million in 2025, a 7.4% increase from CA$9.28 million in 2024, reflecting the high sensitivity and value of financial data.\nPharmaceutical breaches cost CA$7.99 million, incidents across this sector have the potential to expose intellectual property and delay treatments by impacting supply.\nBreaches in the industrial sectors cost an average of CA$8.39 million, as these organizations have a low tolerance for downtime, making them easy targets for attackers.\n\nHow AI is Transforming Cybersecurity Operations\n\nThe report highlights that organizations extensively adopting AI and automation across their security operations centre (SOC) see significant financial benefits. AI tools automate manual cybersecurity tasks, including across threat detection and response, allowing security teams to focus on higher-priority initiatives.\n\nSecurity automation accelerates response times and reduces the impact of breaches. Organizations using these tools extensively reported faster breach identification, with the Mean Time to Identify (MTTI) reduced to 118 days, compared to 162 days for organizations not using these technologies.\n\nWhat It Means for Canadians\n\nData breaches are not just a corporate issue – they affect everyone. When organizations lose millions to cyberattacks, it impacts Canadians through:\n\nHigher Costs for Goods and Services: Businesses often pass on breach costs to consumers by increasing the prices of their goods or services.\nStolen Personal Data: Breaches frequently expose personal information, including banking details, health records, and more.\nService Disruptions: Breaches can lead to delays in shipments, cancelled appointments, and interruptions in critical services.\n\nRecommendations for Canadian Businesses\n\nGovern and Secure AI Systems: Develop policies to manage the use of AI, prevent shadow AI, and ensure compliance with privacy laws.\nInvest in Security Automation: Use AI tools to detect and contain breaches faster.\nConnect security for AI and governance for AI: Investing in integrated security and governance software can help organizations automatically discover and govern shadow AI.\nExpand Employee Training: Strengthen security awareness programs to minimize human error.\n\nAdditional sources:\n\nDownload a copy of the 2025 Cost of a Data Breach Report to learn more.\nSign up for the 2025 IBM Cost of a Data Breach webinar on Wednesday, August 13, 2025, at 11:00 a.m. ET.\nRead more about the report's top findings in this IBM blog.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nLorraine Baldwin\n\nIBM Canada Communications\n\n[email protected]\n\nMedia Resources: B-Roll and Voiceover Scripts\n\nSOURCE IBM",

      "description": "Boost Your Daily Steps with Mobile Health Apps\n\nWalking is well known to have significant health benefits, but few people achieve the daily recommended steps. Fortunately, mobile health (mHealth) applications have emerged as promising tools to promote physical activity. These apps track user activities on mobile devices to deliver health and wellness services. However, the effectiveness of these apps in increasing daily walking behavior remains underexplored, partly due to variations in their incentive structures.\n\nMobile health apps have revolutionized the way individuals approach their daily physical activity goals. By leveraging the convenience and ubiquity of smartphones, these applications offer personalized solutions to encourage users to lead more active lifestyles. From step tracking to goal setting and social support features, mHealth apps provide a comprehensive approach to promoting regular physical activity.\n\nThe Impact of Mobile Health Apps on Daily Steps\n\nResearch indicates that the use of mobile health apps can significantly boost daily step counts among users. A study published in a leading medical journal found that individuals who engaged with a step-tracking app increased their daily walking by an average of 30%. This highlights the potential of mHealth apps to motivate individuals to adopt healthier behaviors and achieve recommended activity levels.\n\nFurthermore, the gamification elements integrated into many mobile health apps have been shown to enhance user engagement and adherence to physical activity goals. By incorporating challenges, rewards, and social interactions, these apps create a supportive environment that encourages users to stay active and consistently strive towards their step targets.\n\nPersonalized Incentives and Behavior Change\n\nOne of the key factors influencing the effectiveness of mobile health apps in promoting daily steps is the design of personalized incentives. Studies have demonstrated that tailored feedback and rewards based on individual preferences and goals can significantly impact behavior change. By offering incentives such as virtual badges, discounts, or charitable donations tied to step achievements, mHealth apps can motivate users to increase their physical activity levels.\n\nMoreover, the integration of social features within these apps allows users to connect with friends, family, or online communities to share their progress, compete in challenges, and provide mutual support. This social support network plays a crucial role in sustaining motivation and fostering a sense of accountability, leading to long-term adherence to healthy habits.\n\nChallenges and Opportunities for Mobile Health Apps\n\nWhile mobile health apps hold great potential in promoting daily steps and improving overall health outcomes, several challenges exist that need to be addressed. One of the primary concerns is the lack of standardization in app features and functionalities, which can lead to variability in user experiences and outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, issues related to data privacy and security pose significant barriers to widespread adoption of mHealth apps. Users are increasingly cautious about sharing personal health information through mobile platforms, highlighting the importance of robust data protection measures and transparent privacy policies in app development.\n\nThe Future of Mobile Health Apps in Physical Activity Promotion\n\nAs technology continues to advance and consumer demand for health and wellness solutions grows, the future of mobile health apps in promoting physical activity looks promising. Developers are increasingly focusing on integrating artificial intelligence, machine learning, and wearable devices to enhance the functionality and effectiveness of these apps.\n\nBy leveraging real-time data analytics and personalized recommendations, mHealth apps can offer tailored guidance and support to users, helping them optimize their daily activity levels and achieve their fitness goals. With ongoing advancements in app design and user engagement strategies, mobile health apps are poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of preventive healthcare and promoting active lifestyles.\n\n©",

      "description": "By Adam Cancryn, CNN \n \n(CNN) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday will make a fresh push to improve Americans' access to their own medical records, tasking dozens of major health and technology companies with solving an issue that has long bedeviled the federal government. \n \nThe plan is expected to center on a pledge that roughly 60 companies will sign — including tech giants Microsoft and Oracle — to help develop new ways for more easily sharing patient data across the US's fragmented health care system, three people familiar with the matter told CNN. Trump is slated to tout the voluntary framework during a White House speech on Wednesday. \n \nYet it remains unclear how quickly the companies can make progress on such a sweeping goal — and how the administration plans to hold them accountable for following through on the high-level, nonbinding commitment. The proposal may also spark pushback from privacy advocates who have warned that making patients' sensitive health data more widely accessible risks also making it less secure. \n \nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the largest federal health programs, declined to comment on the details of the announcement. But in a statement, spokesperson Catherine Howden said the \"initiative aims to build a smarter, more secure and more personalized healthcare system — one that improves patient outcomes, reduces provider burden and drives greater value through private sector innovation and aligned federal leadership.\" \n \nBloomberg News first reported some of the initiative's details . \n \nThe move represents the latest in a long line of attempts by the federal government to give patients greater access and control over their own health records, which often don't smoothly transfer from one health provider to another. Meanwhile, there's a newly added benefit for Silicon Valley, which has heavily invested in a growing array of consumer health, wellness and artificial intelligence startups that stand to gain from users being able to more seamlessly download their data and direct it to the apps of their choice. \n \nAmy Gleason, the acting administrator of DOGE and a former health tech executive, and Arda Kara, who worked at big data firm Palantir before joining the Trump health department, have led the medical records push, two of the people familiar said. \n \nThe pledge comes two-and-a-half months after the health department issued a request for input from health and tech companies for improving the nation's \"digital health ecosystem.\" \n \nPast Democratic and Republican administrations have made improving health record access a policy priority, arguing that it's critical to providing patients with better and more efficient care. But progress in Congress and within the federal government has been slowed by the thicket of technical challenges and privacy considerations surrounding Americans' most sensitive health data. \n \nTrump officials are planning to try a different route, relying on the private sector to make headway on those thorny problems ahead of any significant government intervention, the people familiar said. \n \nThe tactic mirrors the hands-off approach the administration has taken on other top health priorities, such as encouraging food companies to voluntarily remove artificial dyes from products and getting insurers to commit to improving a \"prior authorization\" process often blamed for delaying patients' care. \n \nBut overhauling health records access will likely require broad collaboration among competitors across the health and technology industries, raising questions about whether the private sector will be able to agree on a host of minute details with broad implications. \n \nPlus, previous pushes have prompted significant concerns among privacy advocates and some parts of the health industry. Those groups worried that giving Americans greater ability to share their records will undermine federal efforts to keep their information private, making it easier for people to unwittingly expose their most sensitive data to companies with poor security or bad intentions, which could profit by selling that data. \n \nThe-CNN-Wire \n™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Healthcare has been basing, going back to April; not going up, not going down, just traveling sideways. Meanwhile, Technology has been doing very, very well...and getting very, very over bought (looks a lot like the S&P 500). If we start to see a correctional move in the S&P, we could see a move to areas in which there is good fundamental value (like Healthcare), and also into areas that have been beaten up: They're not going down anymore, but they haven't been rising, either. These could catch some rotational action. Basic Materials, Industrials, and Transports all have been doing well as a result of the <span class=\"highlight\">AI</span>-chase and the associated infrastructure build-out. But Utilities, however, have been doing okay as a mixed bag of companies: These may come to be seen as a risk-off defensive play. Similarly, REIT's haven't gone anyway as a function of interest rates. There remains risk of a correction; timing is always the problem.

It just basically rotates from where it is. So we start to get a correction or move in the market. We could see money rotate into some of these areas like health care that, you know, have good fundamental value, create cash flow rates which have dividend yield. They're in stable companies and they could very well catch some of that risk off rotation in that type of environment. Uh, we're gonna go through a couple of sectors in the market today. So here's what you need to know before the bell. I was, uh, doing Fox business yesterday with Charles Payne, talking about health care stocks in particular. And one of the reasons are, is that they have been under a lot of pressure here as of late. And again, we're seeing this kind of rotational move within the markets. Uh, but health care has been baiting now uh, for, for quite the last couple of months, really going back to April. Just been kind of building a base in health care. It's not really going anywhere. It's not going up. It's not going down. It's just kind of traveling sideways here. Uh, but building a pretty decent base. And again, what if.",

      "description": "I've been in the game 17 years now. I'd recommend you pursue two paths as aggressively as you can:\n\n1. Audience building. In my view, this is the core skill of marketers moving forward in many situations. You know how writers used to be hired for their ability to write, and then publishing houses did the marketing? But now they give book deals to people with pre-existing audiences? It's like that. Future CMOs will already have 100k+ followers on a platform somewhere.\n2. AI. I can't believe how far they've come or so fast. I feel like a dinosaur saying I've been using GPT based tools since 2022 now, way before ChatGPT came out. They are NOT good at creating original content or ideas. But they're becoming legit amazing at taking good ideas and helping me turn them into reality. Staying on the bleeding edge of AI capabilities makes you attractive as an employee and it's also (I think) the only way to protect against getting replaced by AI.\n\nThat's more than I meant to type but I hope it helps. Read books, join communities too. Those have been the two best sources of info for me over the years. Books because they go deep. Communities because that's where you find what's working like right now. :)\n\nP.S. Listening to business Audiobooks has been a key strategy for me to keep learning even when my life is busy. I've listened to most of the major marketing books in the last decade or so. But also read books about sales, business, entrepreneurship, etc. Whatever I can get my hands on that will give me an edge professionally.",

It's opening the door for the two dimensions of warfare that drive this physical and spiritual. At the end, the physical is the informational war, and information becomes a weaponized tool and you start to see.

I'm Rachel Warren, joined today by Motley Fool analysts Louis Whiteman and John Frost. Today we're talking mag seven spending plans and tariff turmoil. But we have to start with the big macro picture first. We learned Wednesday that the US economy returns to growth in Q2. US gross domestic product, which is a measure of the value of goods and services produced across the economy, rose by 3% in the second quarter. That's up from a 0.5% contraction in the first quarter of the year, and it's actually ahead of the consensus estimate. We also saw that consumer spending rose by more than 1% in Q2. Now this was as exports declined single digits and imports fell by more than 30%.",

There were all sorts of reasons holding me on for a long time, but, uh, but I'm off social media entirely. And one of the things that kind of inspired me was this sort of fringe internet theory called dead internet theory, that a lot of what we consume and see, a lot of the comments that are made may not even be generated by real human people, that what's sold to us is real interaction. Could be a lot of this, like <span class=\"highlight\">AI</span>, slop or bots. And I just want to throw that out there as, uh, as an influence on me.
